Like if they sold this game for 300 dollars I would probably buy it. In fact, it's the only Switch game I own, and have no real plans to purchase anything else because between the original game and Master Mode, I will be getting a divorce soon so I can spend more time collecting mushrooms and climbing mountains.",

    "review Text": "This is how you revitalize a franchise that was starting to grow stale in it's formula. I bought a Switch just to play this game and I do not regret my purchase. I'm going to go over pros and cons to make this review a little easier to read.PROS:+ HUGE OPEN WORLD - Lots of interesting places and things to discover. It's quite exhilarating to scale a mountain in order to get a better view of everything around you and then paraglide to points of interest. If you can see a place on the map, you can get to it.+ COMBAT EXPERIMENTATION - Combat experimentation is fun and rewarding, for awhile (more explanation in 'cons' section).+ FUN AND VARIED COMBAT (FOR AWHILE) - Different enemy types are interesting and have specific tactics that clearly telegraph their moves making combat a rewarding learning experience and almost never feels cheap.+ RPG ELEMENTS - The RPG elements fit very nicely into the Zelda universe and give the game a lot of depth. Mountable horses have different stats, enemies can have different elemental types along with stronger variations, weapons, armor, and shields have wildly different stats and abilities, food and elixirs provide different buffs, etc.+ GAME DIFFICULTY - The game is relatively difficult compared to previous Zelda games. You really have to assess combat situations before entering the fray and many enemies are punishing. You will die, many times, but you do learn, with time, and with learning comes triumph and satisfaction. DLC adds Master Mode for the most hardcore players or those who found Normal too easy.+ COOKING SYSTEM - Cooking system is deep and rewards experimentation. Cooking not only allows for the crafting of meals and elixirs which gives you numerous buffs, but it's also one of the best ways to make money.+ WEAPON DURABILITY - Weapon and shield durability forces you to continually hunt for new gear and keeps combat interesting and tense. While I didn't think I would like this system at first, it makes for a much more engaging game than just getting a single, over-powered item and just relying on that the rest of the game, which would get boring, imo.+ SHRINES - There's over 120 'shrines' which are peppered all over the map which act like mini-dungeons. They usually can be completed in 10 minutes or less and usually involve the use of several of Link's Runes (that you get at the beginning of the game) that give you the ability to move metallic objects from a distance, throw bombs, summon ice pillars, or even freeze objects and apply force to them to launch into enemies or to other places to help solve puzzles. I love these shrines because they're fun to solve, and due to the game's physics engine, many can be solved in ways the developers probably didn't intend (look up YouTube videos on it). Shrines are short enough that they're not a huge time investment like normal Zelda dungeons that used to demand an hour+ of your time to complete, making them ideal for short gaming sessions.+ NO HAND HOLDING - Doesn't explain much, doesn't hold your hand, and expects you to learn everything from the world, NPCs, and experimentation.CONS:- BARREN FEELING OPEN-WORLD - The world feels very barren and empty, much of the time. Many say the map is 'dense' but I don't think that's an accurate word to describe it. The map is loaded with things to do, but there is lots of empty space between those points of interest. Think if you took the map of Skyrim (a game I would call 'dense') and expanded it by 3 times the size, including time to travel between points of interest. Horses don't really help with traversal especially when you're moving across mountainous or rocky terrain.- COMBAT GETS STALE - Combat experimentation becomes less effective as you become stronger. Ambushes with bombs, chu chu jellies, stasis, etc, all become less and less rewarding as enemies become stronger. Before, a carefully aimed bomb could kill an enemy, outright, or roll into barrels which would take out an entire encampment, now a bomb does roughly 5% damage and most other means are hardly worth the effort over just using brute-force. For a game that really rewarded this kind of behavior at the start, I was bummed that I couldn't rely on those tactics later in the game, adding to the combat feeling stale and repetitive after awhile.- CAN'T SUMMON HORSES FROM ANYWHERE - Horses cannot be summoned from anywhere. The DLC solves this with 2 different solutions, but it should have been in the base game and been an early quest/reward before you spend 50+ hours exploring the map. This was super frustrating to me when walking to Gerudo town, which ended up being close to 25 minutes of walking/running from the nearest shrine. A horse would have made this trek much more bearable but there were no stables nearby to even take it out of.- INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND GENERAL UI - Inventory management and the menu UI could use a little work. While I loved having so many interesting items and ingredients to discover and experiment with, moving through the menus got tedious, especially when you have multiple pages of stuff to sort through or when you find new, better weapons/shields and have to go back into your menus to drop some to make space. Menus felt cluttered and even after 80 hours, I would still fumble through menus trying to do specific things.- PERFORMANCE AND LOAD TIMES - The game runs pretty well a majority of the time, but there are certain places where it will chug, specifically when there's lots of particle effects on-screen or there's a lot of things to render. This also makes load times get kind of old, as it can take up to 20 seconds to load into new areas or even just reload the area you are in, after dying. Even dying in a shrine results in a 10 second reload, which is baffling since they're not in the open-world and shouldn't take that long to render, especially when they've already been rendered before your death.- GRAPHICS - While the game looks pretty good most of the time, there's other times that the hardware limitations really show, like when you're trekking across big meadows or rocky mountains with little detail. It looks really good for a handheld system, but doesn't quite hold up to console standards, even compared to last gen.- EXPLAINS NOTHING - While I love that the game doesn't hold your hand, I was equally frustrated by not having a clue how to do certain things. While a purist would argue that all the answers are SOMEWHERE in the game or that you should just experiment, someone like me just doesn't have the patience to play 90% of the games content to then find out that a certain ability will significantly help map traversal and reduce travel time. I want to know these things up-front or at the latest, halfway through the game, since getting an ability to improve travel time feels less rewarding when I've already slowly trekked through a vast majority of the map at 60 hours. DLC rewards are not as great if you have nearly completed and covered the entire base game... what's the use of a horse or motorcycle you can summon anywhere if you don't have anything left to explore?Anyways, I absolutely love this game. Given the number of rather large gripes that I had with it, I felt like a 4 is a fair score. I really look forward to the next game but I hope people can acknowledge and admit the game's shortcomings, otherwise, these things won't be fixed in order to give us the most refined and amazing follow-up that we all are already salivating for.",

And I don't really feel like moving on at this point.This is a huge, HUGE game. I've explored maybe 10%. The graphics are excellent, the soundtrack is great if a bit minimalist. It's big, it's WIDE open, and it's super-involved. Weapons break on you. Stocks of ammunition (i.e. arrows) run out. If you want to eat, you need to collect and then cook your food. If you want to cook your food you need to find yourself some fire. And on, and on.Big, open, involved -- all of these are probably plusses for a lot of gamers, and this game has certainly received its fair share of great reviews. But here's the thing: I'm an adult, with a real life and responsibilities. And every time I sit down in front of this game I spend two or three hours collecting supplies and cooking food and fighting various monsters, all without making much progress. Why bother?!Breath of the Wild, maybe it's not you. Maybe it's me. But you're no Link Between Worlds. You're certainly no Ocarina of Time. You feel like a big mess of a game that just doesn't quite come together and, as phrased so brilliantly by Sweet Brown, ain't nobody got time for that.",

I've not played video games for over 25 years until getting the switch and BOTW.  I am amazed at how much gaming has improved and how much I've missed out!  I like that this game is not all about fighting and is not too violent and gruesome.  The game is fun for all ages and even my youngest 5 year old boy enjoys playing it, although he mostly just explores the villages and experiment with cooking.  The biggest problem with this game is that it is so addictive that we'll play it all day and don't want to do anything else. So my wife is not too happy.",

You won't want to turn off your Nintendo Switch and you will be glad you purchased one if for nothing else than for the ability to play this game...but don't sleep, there's TONS of great Nintendo 1st party titles on the horizon that Nintendo fans will WANT TO PLAY!Back to Zelda though, the atmosphere, graphics, sound and gameplay are all SPOT ON. There's crafting of Food, Potions, Weapons and Armor as well as a bunch of quests, side quests and tons of hidden content to keep you engrossed for at least the next several months... The Game of the Year buzz that this game has received is 100% deserved. Get this game! You will LOVE It!",

First, it’s barren...it’s a giant huge amazing world with NOTHING IN IT.  No, i dont count boring little pig monsters or re-skins of boring little pig monsters, or endless crafting things that don’t make anything remotely cool, or another melee weapon that breaks after 3 swings.  These are not content.  Second, it’s repetitive.  They got rid of big themed dungeons...I’m honestly not sure why but Im not against it if they did something cool. They did not.  They made a bunch, maybe hundreds, of small dungeons that feel incredibly joyless and give you nothing cool.There’s just nothing to build to, nothing story wise (the whole story is told through flashbacks)Cannot believe people are pretending this is a good game.  In 5 years no one will be talking about it.",

Let me just say that it is insanely good. It is epic. It is like all the imaginings I had as a kid playing dice RPGs. The freedom of being able to explore such a large, rich, intricate and gorgeous world is fantastic. Climbing mountains, gliding down into charming villages, galloping through open countryside on horseback, running along wooded trails, hunting, foraging and cooking, dodging thunderstorms, conquering shrines. Even just gazing at the landscape from the top of a tower is just awesome.This game is so good we have to set timers to remind us to take a break.If only we could just climb in ;-)",

    "review Text": "In 1987 there was a gold cartridge that was obviously better than the rest. That's when I played Zelda for the first time. I was a toddler and still remember what an adventure it was. Since there was little text I could still play even though I had no one to read it to me. It was my driving force to learn to read and count. It was my favorite game year after year. Now 30 years later and this is almost the game I imagined from staring at the manual art and blocky pixels on that limited palette of the NES. I have not bought a Nintendo game in over a decade, and this was the first game that made me buy a nintendo console since the Cube. The world is vast and feels old giving a real feel of a adventure, the combat is ingauging, the difficulty is perfect, physics are the best around, cooking is accually entertaining and worth while, the ability to climb really adds something, the art design is great at hiding the 720p/900p resolution, and the ammount of things to see is awesome, the puzzles are well done for the most part, and the lack of direction harkens back to the NES game. On the downside the story is not in the league of say Witcher 3, the music can feel to subdued in my opinion, voice acting is sparse and should have been fully voiced or not at all, and the weapons do break to often. The gameplay makes up for all of this though. I am addicted to the gameplay, and you set the pace. I'm typically a 60fps4k pc gamer, but this game is just done so well. So is this game a nostalgia trip. YES! But it is an amazing experience. So here we are 30 years after the original golden cartridge that first really got me into video games and this is a worthy successor. My 4yo son sits with me when I let him. I help him play, and read him the text. It is one of his favorite things to do. He is starting to sounding out words with me and counting his money. Though he has me to read to him. Seriously this cartridge should have been gold.",

    "review Text": "I don't understand what all the hype is about over this game.  I have been playing it for awhile and I hate it, for various reasons.  First, it's an open world game with no sense of direction that I've found.  Everything is so vague and there's no way you will figure out this game without consulting the internet for QnA and walkthroughs.  One thing I absolutely HATE when trying to play a game.  When I want to play a game, I don't want to have to keep stepping away from the screen to go log on my computer to figure out...  what do I do next?  Where do I go?  How do I make this recipe?For example, in the very beginning, you need to complete 3 trials in 3 shrines.  Well that's all fine and dandy, except the 3rd shrine is located atop a mountain that is cold.  You can't get there without some way to keep yourself warm.  I wandered around this area countless hours until I finally by luck stumbled upon some old diary that said something about making a recipe that keeps you warm.  Who would have known?  You will have no idea until you stumble upon this isolated small shack and find the diary.  But doesn't give you the recipe!!!  You have to figure it out on your own because the stupid old man wrote the diary forgot the final recipe and it's up to you to figure that out.  Yeah good luck with that.  The first ingredient is peppers which you can find and pick.  The 2nd recipe is raw meat.  which takes quite awhile to figure out how to even find.  You have to wander around some more until you find some boars in a forest to kill.  As for the 3rd ingredient, you will be a week putting together all sorts of different combinations to find the 3rd is a fish.  You have no way of figuring this out unless you get on the internet and look it up.I spent hours and hours just wandering around in this game figuring out what I'm supposed to do.  I cannot STAND games like that.  Just wander around until by luck you stumble upon something related to your quest.  At which point, you need to blindly wander around some more.I don't know about the people who wrote the positive reviews, but I have a life.  I have a job, I have a family and a home.  What I DON'T have, is countless hours to wander around doing nothing.  Hours and hours and hours trying to figure out where the shrines are and how to make some stupid recipe that you have to guess on your own.  And this is only the beginning of the game.  I don't even want to think about what it's like in the later levels.Now that that's out of the way, my other complaint is about the weapons.  You have sticks, swords, spears, bows, clubs all sorts  of weapons.  Cool right?  Except they are  all junk.  After you kill a couple of goblins, the weapon breaks.  In the middle of a fight and all of a sudden, your sword has broken!!!  Then you have to fart around the menu to equip another sword.  You swipe it a few times and oops!  It's broke too!  Let's try the club.  Broke!  Equip the spear.  Broke!!!  I'm tired of hoarding swords and spears in my bag because they keep breaking.  And your SOL if they all break.  Yeah you can't fight without a weapon.  Link just looks at his empty hand like he's stupid.  Just ball up your fist and punch the goblin in the face or kick him where it counts.  Nope he just looks at his hand.  So what do you do when you break all your weapons?  You guessed it.  Run away.  Then you have to waaaaaander around blindly until you stumble on an axe or something.  Same with the bows.  They break too.And what happens during a boss fight?  SAME THING.  You dodge his attack and mash him a round then your weapon breaks and he has hardly any damage done at all.  But then you have to go to the menu and equip another weapon.  In the meantime, by the time that's done, hes coming in for a other attack.  Same sequence.  Dodge, attack, weapon breaks, replaced.  But when he hits you ONCE, its game over and you have to continue and sit through the load screen.  Not to mention the music is freaking pathetic and annoying.Weapons breaking, constantly healing after one hit, This is incredibly stupid to have to do when you are in the middle of an intense fight where you need to focus on what your doing rather than mess around swapping out weapons that keep breaking.Forget this.  Going to game stop tomorrow to trade this in.  I don't have time for this kind of garbage. I bought a Nintendo switch just for this game, because I read it was a good game.  Looks like I'm putting the switch away and hooking my PS4 back up and put back in my latest Final Fantasy game, where at least my weapons don't break, I don't die in one hit and I have some sort of sense of direction and what I'm supposed to do.Fing garbage. I want my money back.  For game AND the switch.  Nintendo can suck it.",

    "review Text": "One of the best games I've played.  I love Zelda games but to be honest it's been a long time since I been entranced by a Zelda game.  I just didn't think the latest Zelda games prior to Breath of the Wild lived up to their hype.  So I didn't think BotW would either and the videos online didn't really capture my attention either.  But it's hard to capture how fun it is in a video.Normally I lose interest pretty fast in open world games because there is just so much to do and the growing list feels daunting.  BotW's world is insanely massive, as in it makes Skyrim's world look small, but I don't find myself losing interest.  In fact I have the opposite problem.  Once I feel like I have asserted my dominance in one area I see another area off in the distance that piques my interest and in BotW you can go anywhere you can see.  No invisible walls or mountains too high.And then the game rewards you if you like to experiment.  It doesn't punish you and try to limit it eggs you on.  The potion/cooking system alone will give you useful rewards for experiments.  But it doesn't stop there.  You can change the properties of many things just by exposing them to the elements.  You may be weak to an element (heat/cold) but you can use items in various ways to overcome the environment.  You may also find yourself weaker to an element by what you're doing.  (e.g. don't wield a metal weapon during a lightning storm ...or swim)  Sloshing around in puddles will alert your presence to the enemy but sometimes bad weather and/or nighttime can help you sneak up on them.",

Based on the reviews, I was expecting the pinnacle of open world gaming on the Switch. Instead I am treated to a seemingly never-ending sequence of climbing, gliding, fighting, and cooking. Although an aesthetically beautiful game, with simple mechanics, there are some flaws that are really killing my buzz.The shrines are too far in between and far too short. I've found one repeat shrine (Small Test of Strength) and assume there are more. After the tutorial area shrines, there's no storyline requirement to hit any shrines. They are merely there for you to grind hearts and stamina. The Divine Beasts are more enjoyable dungeon experiences due to their size and complexity. I wish there were fewer, more involved shrines with better rewards.There is little variety in the monsters you'll come across, except that some groups are substantially stronger than others with no visual indication. A major source of frustration to me has been hopping one region over and being OHKO by the exact same creature that was previously hitting for a half heart per hit. This KILLS the open world feel for me because I feel as if I'm being herded through the easier regions.The weapon and shield inventory limits are ridiculous considering how quickly these items break. I have this gripe with many games, but monsters don't play by the same rules. Hit their shields as much as you like--they won't break. Tank as much damage as you want--they're still holding pristine weapons. The handful of repairable weapons in the world just don't cut it, as they can only be reforged by certain NPCs and it costs a stupid amount of resources. This is the first game I've played in close to 25 years of gaming where weapons break with this frequency and it is maddening.The world is expansive, but it's mostly open, empty space. I do like that there are little secrets sprinkled throughout a region--not concentrated around a settlement or something. But by and large you can make a bee-line from one point of interest to the next without missing anything important. In light of my above complaints, this is probably the safer way to play. And that's really the problem. If a game doesn't reward exploration, why make it massively explorable?",

    "review Text": "I've put somewhere between 50-75 hours into this game and I have to say that I just don't get the gushing, unqualified love for this game.  In fact, after about 10-15 hours, I was pretty close to just giving up on it, but I kept playing it expecting for it to click.  It never did.  In my view, it's a OK game, but that's it.  It's not the best game on the Switch, and it's not the best game in its genre.The good:- The developers obviously put a lot of time into the game, and it shows.  There are a lot of different landscapes, the artwork is interesting, and I can only remember one bug in all the time that I played.  It is a polished, finished game.  Especially with large, open-world games, that's pretty rare, and I appreciate that.- The controls are solid, although there is some awkward button-mashing required in spots that can be frustrating.  This is particularly true for the dodge mechanic, which requires a three-button combination that, if not executed just right, will just result in a crouch that gets you clobbered by a bad guy.- It's suitable for children, which is nice.  Few of these types of games are.The not so good:- The game is awfully repetitive.  There is a really big, open, world, and that's great.  Many of the areas have different artwork and are pretty to look at.  But really, most of the territories are basically the same with different artwork layered over the top.-With a big, open world, you would expect that there would be a lot to do.  There's really not, at least as far as I can tell.  There is a main quest and there is discovering shrines.  There are a handful of side quests, but they're pretty one-dimensional and involve either discovering a shrine or running an errand for someone.  Other games like this (Fallout, Skyrim, Witcher, Horizon Zero Dawn, GTA, etc.) have some pretty involved B stories that can be just as good as the main game.-BOTW is full of some interesting ideas that are executed in a way that just makes the game too tedious and downright boring in spots.  For example:- There are something like 120 shrines to discover.  That sounds like a lot, but all the shrines fall into one of three categories:  a fight, a platformer, or a puzzle.  Every shrine is a variation of one of those three, and with 120, that gets pretty old.  In Fallout 3, a much better game, each Vault had a different story and was relatively unique.  Because of that, they were quite fun and interesting to explore.  There's nothing interesting about the shrines in BOTW once you play the first few.  Beating the shrines is important to level up your character, though, so there is a lot of repetitive grinding.- There are a lot of mountains and cliffs in the game.  It makes for interesting landscape, and you can climb them, which is a cool and different idea, but climbing is very slow, and some of the cliffs are quite big.  It's just boring to sit there for 45-60 seconds doing nothing but holding the climb button.  Worse, sometimes it rains and the cliffs become too slick to climb.  But if you need to go up the cliff to get where you're going, there is nothing to do but stand there and wait for it to stop raining.  I've actually just put down the controller and left to make myself a sandwich while I waited for it to stop raining.  What's the point of that?-Speaking of rain, the weather changes.  That's neat I guess, but they've messed it up by making it a game mechanic.  Sometimes it will storm, so if you are holding a metal weapon or a metal shield, you'll get struck by lightning and die (this also causes an inventory management problem, which I discuss below).  It rains a lot in the game but doesn't always storm, so it's easy to miss when it starts if you're not paying attention.  You'll just be wandering around and then get struck by lighting and instantly die.  That's annoying.  It also goes from extreme hot to extreme cold rather quickly.  If you don't have the proper clothing, you will die very quickly.  So for example, in the desert, the daytime is very hot and the nighttime is very cold; each require special outfits.  This might be realistic, but time passes quickly and it gets old to have to keep changing outfits every five minutes.  Again, how is this a fun game mechanic?-There is a big, open-world map, so getting from place to place can be tedious.  Other open-world games, like Fallout or Witcher, solve this problem by being able to fast travel basically anywhere.  You can fast travel in BOTW, too, but you are limited to being able to fast travel only to two types of locations:  towers and shrines.  That means that after you fast travel, you often have a lot of walking (or worse, climbing) to get to where you want to go.  That's boring.  You can also get a horse, but because so much of the map is mountainous, their utility is rather low.- Your weapons and shields deteriorate.  That's fine, plenty of other games have done that.  But in those games, there is a way to repair your equipment.  In this game, there isn't, and most of the weapons will deteriorate very quickly--just a handful of fights with monsters.  So you have this perverse incentive when you get good weapons to not use them because of a concern that they will break and then you won't have them later for the boss battles or occasional more powerful monster that you run across.-  By itself, the deterioration issue probably wouldn't be terrible.  When it is combined with a limited inventory and specialized weapons, it becomes downright awful.  You only have a few weapons slots, but you have to horde weapons because you never know when they might break.  Worse, some monsters a particularly vulnerable to a single type of weapon--ice sword, fire sword, etc.  So you always want to make sure you have one of each of those.  And, when it storms, you can't use a metal weapon, so you have to keep a wooden weapon, too.  You wind up always fretting about what weapons to keep and which to drop, and when.  It's frustrating to drop a weapon that you need later because you didn't have room for it at the time.  It's just unnecessary.-To recover health, you have to cook meals in a pot.  That's fine, but it takes a lot of time and clicks to gather items out of your inventory and then a few more seconds for them to actually cook.  It doesn't sound like much, but if you want to prepare 10-15 meals to prepare for a boss battle (or because you don't have the proper equipment and need the temporary boost that a meal provides), it's really tiresome to sit at the fire and do stuff over and over again.- There are really only a handful of different monsters you fight.  The monsters that you meet in the first few minutes of the game will be seen through the rest of the game, except more powerful.  When you go to a new area, it's basically the same monsters, except there is an \"ice\" version, a \"fire\" version, or a \"skeleton\" version.In sum, the bones are here for a good game, but it's just not a good game.  I can tell they put a lot of work into the game, and for that I am appreciative.  But gosh, shouldn't the game be fun?  Three stars is as high as I can go, and that might even be a bit generous.If you like the open world game, you've probably already played many of the games that are far and away better than BOTW.  Fallout 3, New Vegas, Skyrim, GTA and Witcher (available on Switch) are clearly better.  If you are looking for an open world game that is suitable for a child, Lego City Undercover (available on Switch) is better than BOTW, and usually half the price.  If you also have a PS4, Horizon Zero Dawn is a game that has the same motif as BOTW, but is much, much better in nearly every way.",

There are often many different ways to tackle any problem and your only limitation is your imagination. It took some time to get used to the controls (might take less time for someone who is more used to fighting games), but they make sense once you do. The worst part of the game is that it uses the button function of the joysticks, so if you apply too much pressure (as you might during an intense fight), you will either crouch or go into scope mode. Obviously, these are both very bad things when you're trying to maneuver around an enemy. Some people complain there are too many shrines. I don't think so. I love the shrines. Each one is a puzzle and though some elements are repeated, I do not feel they are repetitive as each requires you to think about how to use those elements in a new way. I've also seen people complain about the korok seeds, but I don't see how that's a problem? It's a fun little bonus to find and it only helps you by expanding your inventory. If you don't want to go around looking for them, don't. Trust me, you will stumble across plenty as you're exploring.",

I haven't played a Zelda game since the first two on the NES, and I never had a particular allegiance to either that franchise or to Nintendo in particular. But Breath of the Wild is one of the all time best games across all platforms. I bought a Switch primarily to play Xenoblade 2, and got this because \"Well, I guess it looks pretty cool.\" Fast forward a few hours of gameplay, and that synopsis became: \"Oh hey, it's like they took every moment of my childhood spent watching Saturday morning cartoons, added the ability to scale sheer walls and hang-glide, and injected it back into my heart.\" If you don't have the adequate memories for gamer nostalgia, grab this game and start making some. The combat is fun, varied, and rewarding; the world is gigantic and alive with wind and weather and light. There's a sense of distance and reasons to explore. There are lots of things to do and lots of ways to do them. There is a full spectrum of moods from tranquil to majestic to intense. Few games come this close to getting everything right. Now of course I can't guarantee that any game is for everyone. If you're a cool kid and you think your friends will tease you if they catch you outside of Dark Souls, by all means, stay away. Actually, forget your friends. You have Breath of the Wild now.",

This game has restored my hope for a fun gaming future with my kids. It can be played slowly and methodically or straight to the story line objectives, there’s no wrong way. It has a good slow burn and I imagine will be enjoying many hours with it. My child has blasted through main quests and is now enjoying expansion packs and side quests. We’ve had it for about 10 months. There are arrows flying and fighting monster creatures with crazy mythical powered swords and hammers but you are rarely taking aim at something that has human likeness (except those darn Yiga) and there’s no gore involved. In Zelda BOTW if you hunt a deer it falls into a nice little pile of raw prime meat, you pick it up, make a fire, and cook it with some herbs you found in the forest.  If you want more realism go play rdr2 after the kids are in bed. I’m sure it would have you up to your elbows in fake deer blood butchering the thing for a realistic 5 hours. Ha!Extremely enjoyable game. Best one available for the switch at this time. I am comfortable with my 4 year old watching and my 9 year old playing. In fact we often are all together jumping up and down cheering someone on to finish a quest or defeat a tough foe. There are many buttons you have to coordinate to control so players younger than about 7 would struggle but they can have fun wandering the forest collecting mushrooms when there’s no hazards present.Super fun.

Some of them are easy but some are very challenging puzzles and can take 45 minutes or more. When I only had an hour or two of free time, this was very frustrating and did not give me the relaxation and recreation that i desperately needed.your character is extremely weak in the beginning and as a new, unskilled player, you die a lot. you have to do a lot of things like cook and craft meals. weapons are CONSTANTLY breaking on you and you have to get new ones. and the puzzles, which have always been a hallmark of zelda games, are genuinely challenging and can be frustrating.bottom line the game was not providing the relaxation i desperately needed in my very stressed out life at the time, and i sold it.however, in 2020 quarantine, with far too much downtime for my own good, and a lot less stress in my life.... this game has proved to be a godsend. when one has adequate time to invest in the game and can appreciate it, it is truly a marvel and a sight to behold. i would put it right up there as one of the best games i have ever played.its not a good game for someone who doesnt have a lot of free time, as it really doesnt work in small doses. you need to have a lot of time to dedicate to it. and in 2020, with not a ton else to do, it's become a godsend.",

PRO tip for those first using the controllers:  if you have not fully-charged the controllers, you might get an hour or two out of the game, but that's it!I don't know who designed this, and I vaguely remember playing it on the Wii years ago, but not THIS. It's a complete environmental immersion into the fantasy world of Hyrule! The back story is pretty old, but it applies so well in this version. The graphics are outstanding! Gameplay is smooth, even though everything is wireless.What I love most about the game is that you can know absolutely nothing, and the game is built to take you on the journey. If you're an advanced player, you can zip through things easily and still find challenges. I haven't yet played through everything, and there are little hidden goodies all over the maps, new things to discover...on and on and on. YES, even cheating via YouTube videos only helps you so much. You still have to perform the tasks! The Japanese-sourced characters, story, and references are very Wii-oriented, and putting nature above all else feels authentic.For those afraid of heights... well... there are moments when you either have to get over it, or you won't be able to perform certain tasks! So cheat, or not, read up or not, or just let the game take you for a very, very, very long ride through gorgeously-rendered landscapes that interact with you! Discover endless puzzles, adventures, and minor social-interactions with a huge cast of characters.The game is forgiving. If you die... you'll be able to continue from a last saved position. Feel that you might lose in a situation? Save first, go back later! Voila! Compared to some of the other much-more-complicated titles out there, this game is completely forgiving!I'm new to the Switch, so perhaps I'm just overwhelmed, but this game blew away my expectations and got me absolutely hooked!NOTE: Legend of Zelda has always been a single-player game. It's designed around a single person playing a single character. There are some multiplayer options - I have not yet explored them. But this isn't a game you sit and play with a partner.

First thing you notice it the new graphics for the Zelda Franchise. It looks like your playing your way through a painting which is truly a work of art. You are literally thrown out there to play with a storyline starting right from the get go. Your first quest is to kill Ganon. You can go straight to him and give that shot. Good luck to ya. Not gonna happen. Now if you play the game right and follow your waypoint on the map for the fisrt while you will learn exactly what you need to learn to get you through the rest of the game. Before you know it you will have quests stacked up in your que like you were playing World of Warcraft. Its not online but it sure seems like the World is big enough to be an MMORPG. It does feel lonely out there sometimes without some friends playing beside you. The quests are excellent in Breath of the Wild. You can Choose whatever you want to do anytime you want to do it. I hear complaints that people felt they were doing the same thing over and over again. Well thats how they were playing. They were going around finishing the Shrines which are little dungeons which you solve puzzles in. Its very important to knock these shrines off but you can break away and just do quests if you like. Or you can collect items for cooking or go looking to catch a horse so you dont have to hoof it everywhere in this huge world. I never felt the world was empty as every way I have gone there was always something to do. You come up on these little camps, which if cleared will result in opening a chest. Battles at first seemed very hard but once I got the hang of it I started clearing camps in no time. To me the game is the perfect open world action RPG. I highly recommend Breath of the Wild to any RPG fan out there. If you play like I do and do all the side quests and try to find all its secrets with p,aying along the storyline you can expect to play at least 100 hours.

    "review Text": "Breath of the Wild is... okay. I know that's an unpopular opinion but honestly anytime you review a mainline Nintendo game as anything less than the Second Coming you're going to get downvoted.Legend of Zelda: Assassin's Creed. So much of Breath of the Wild is cribbed from other open world games. You climb towers to reveal the map. Areas of the map are off-limits until you pass certain story or equipment requirements. If you just add in the \"hay dive\" the core mechanics would look a whole lot like other games.Legend of Strategy Guides. An early quest says climb a tower and identify several places to go next. I do so. I head out toward those points and... I die. I jumped off the no-go zone because I assumed this was the game telling me where to go. So I climb the tower again and look for the \"correct\" places to go, which are literally the same type of places as I scouted before. I was just looking at the \"wrong\" ones... even though they're literally identical so in the early game I have absolutely no way to tell the difference. I have to open my map AFTER I mark a point, verify that it's one of the \"right\" ones, then head off toward the \"correct\" next destination. I die again. It turns out most of these early-game points require cold weather clothing. Climate hasn't been thoroughly explained yet in the game. There are no shops. You can't eat regular food items to restore health when you're cold. So umm... what do I do? I'm barely an hour in, and I have to look up a guide for where the cold-weather clothing is. That's bad. Cold-weather clothing seems to only be available in one cabin, which has nothing to stand out on the map, behind a quest that has next to zero explanation on how to complete it. Not good.Legend of Teleporting Old Men. Nintendo wanted a deserted feel to this part of the world, but they couldn't figure out how to explain mechanics to the player without their usual NPCs. So there's one teleporting old man to stand in for the array of shopkeeps and tutorials a game would normally have. I see through you, Nintendo. When you add up all the places where the old man appears to help you, there are dozens of people living and working in the first area of the game. It isn't really deserted. The people are just hidden behind an invisible wall that makes them all look like the same old man. I don't like that design choice, even if I understand why it was done.Legend of Deserted World Maps. A lot of Breath of the Wild is open space. I totally understand that you're supposed to be drinking in the scenery, the music, the ambiance. But I just got screwed up because the game places several copies of objective markets right in front of you and punished you if you go to the \"wrong\" ones. So now I have several cases where I regret all the backtracking and wasted time I've spent trying to track down the next objective - and I'm still in what amounts to the tutorial. That's not a good sign.I get where Breath of the Wild is going. I appreciate Nintendo tried something \"new\" for a Zelda game. But slapping a Zelda label on a new Assassin's Creed game is not nearly as interesting or groundbreaking as people want to think it is. It's a clever ploy, it sucked in a lot of people, but it doesn't work on me.There are other little things poking at me already. Weapons break too fast, and there's a limited inventory, so early game I feel like I'm throwing a kitchen sink at every enemy. The moment I got unlimited bombs, I quit using my regular weapons entirely whenever I could. It would have been a much better choice, in my opinion, to have a longer life on these weapons so that you're not wasting time and energy managing them early game. You're supposed to be exploring and enjoying the world, not moping because a stick broke. I think they patched some of the late-game problems here, where even very rare weapons broke too quickly so you kept throwing garbage at enemies to preserve your good weapons, but it's still a silly problem to have. I'd prefer the opposite - what if your beginning stick levels up, so you always want to keep it by your side? It could be your companion in the Wild. I think that makes a lot more sense, and then you'd really have to agonize about inventory space.So this game doesn't click for me. I'll play it, just like I play any Assassin's Creed game once in a while. But at least in the early game I'm not excited by anything.",

The gameplay, graphics, and price was to me, it was all on the mark.9/10 First, the gameplay in this Zelda was crisp and clear, it showed the power that the Nintendo Switch was capable of. The world that I played in was so massive, it is a truly a free world platform. I only wish it played a little like previous Zeldas, but this issue is not a big deal.10/10 Second, the graphics were amazing as well. I hardly saw any error in the frame rate or stability of the graphics. It's amazing the fine detail that was placed in every object in the game. It for sure has the best graphics of any Zelda game to date.10/10 Third, the price was very good for all the time and hardwork that was placed in this game. Taking almost 5 years on one game I know they could have raised the price and people would have still bought Zelda: Breath of the Wild.As a result, I thoroughly enjoyed and still do enjoy this game. I felt they worked hard and gave Zelda fans a great gameplay experience, beautiful graphics, and a price well worth paying. I highly suggest buying this game even if your not a fan.Posted by David Fults",

When I was younger with more free time, I would have loved that. Unfortunately, now, that seems like a pain. This isn't really a good game to just pick up and play for an hour each day or week. You really need to put time into this game to fully get the fun out of it - otherwise a lot of things just seem like a chore (cooking, refilling supplies/weapons), etc.",

You choose tasks based on what you want to do and can tame horses, build a house (once you play it enough) and explore for hours. My biggest complaint is how easily all the weapons break, but since this world literally has them scattered everywhere you are never that far off from replenishing your shield, sword, bow, and stock of goods. You can cook by adding random ingredients to pots with fire, and you solve puzzles to learn new magic skills. While other games we finish and sell (we buy the physical games, not digital downloads) this one we have played for months without losing interest. It is reminiscent of some Kings Quest PC games, including the tendency to get lost on side quests and accidentally skipping over important bits you need to go forward. But never fear, there is a huge online community that can help you get unstuck.",

    "review Text": "This is just a fight game I recieved a Used game that was missing it's pamphlet the used order was cancelled that this changed to new condition without approval we would have possibly just cancelled. It is nothing like Zelda Ocarina that was a group of small mini games all sewn together in a fairly great fable. At first I was very hesitant to buy this game because a serious gamer said he beat it in 30 hours and we had a few years of fun playing Zelda Ocarina of Time all it's side games and mini games while using it to teach the children to read instructions. They became great fans of Zelda and when they got older asked for a Wii they specifically asked for the game and bow set up for I guess the name was Link for their birthdays as they both are born in March.  I have not played this Link line of games since Nintendo 64 and as I play through it not using walk throughs as I was told it is a short game I am learning this young man must have skipped all the side actitivies, competitions and looking for all the game gifts just fought his way through the game.I think if the information that comes with the new game helps play the game it would have been worth purchasing a new game or at least a book to help me find things. I do not know if there is a map to discover in the game like in Ocarina but I am very lost and tracking backwards without a good map in this game. I hope it turns up somewhere or I can buy it as I just bought salt for the recipes. The recipes are fun it would be nice if I could keep a list of what was done so I can make the better ones again as I discover them in game play. I find the mountains very difficult to climb without the speed and stamina elixers.It is growing on my slowly.This is not a child's game like Zelda Ocarina of time with brighter colors that would probably be excellent updated for the Switch for younger children...but  it is an adventure game. At first because it is a big jump from the 64 game I did not like it but as time went on it began to grow on me I am beginning to like it but I sure would like a map I am so lost even driving without a physical recent map.Do you want a nice review or do you want the truthThe graphics apparently are very good on Zelda Breath of time for the Switch.But like with Skylanders Imaginators which runs on Toys to Life which I began playing because my nephew plays it on my Switch gifted to me for Christmas.I found the new Switch Zelda game to be very difficult loaded constantly with Boss monsters and difficult puzzles.These is only normal run and Pro run games so it is apparently designed for the hard core gamer unlike the Zelda Ocarina of time I bought used for near new price many years after it as designed for the Nintendo 64 because it was more a younger persons puzzle and adventure game loaded with mini games and not as much violence.This is a Hard core games game apparently someone who just finds a way to fight to the end then resells or soon after purchasing it like I bought it used missing all the pamphlets and information and then it was tried to be foisted off on me as a new game.If it had been new I would have returned it because I am a beginnger level player always will be even though I have playe 20 years.I use walk throughs and information to help me play most games.But as this is a constant fight fight fight M for Mature Violent game now if you are a hard core gamer you can rent the game fight through ignore all the side quests, not enjoy the horses which are very untameable and do not follow good directions so much I often found myself walking and whistling for the away horse.If you like near impossible puzzles and fighting very few clues in a game that does not like to let you go back where you have been and just want to fight through a game this is the game for you.But rent it and play it on the Switch handheld counsel as it looks very washed out on the tv.Designed for the Switch and for the Hardcore gamersNot a child's game.But if you are a hard core gamer I suggest you get the Ammibos to up the gameplay a bit which they do not tell you can be used in the game and run it on professional level before you try to resell it.Also the harder part of the game than the monsters are some of the many Shrine puzzles one which runs like a marble roll game there is a trick I am working out on how to solve it.If it was for a child or a novice player and less about fighting and adventure I am sure it would be kept by the right people driving up the pice like Animal Crossing has.If you want a review that you do not pay fordon't punish the honest person for saying I don't like itBut the hard core gamers love it.So I knew when someone told me they beat it in 30 hours it as probably just a bang bang fight fight hit hit hard core gamers game.I rate it M for Mature and Lots of Game violence as the bully monsters constnatly beat up travelers whom you can save to come back and find them stuck eternally in the same scenario with the same monsters for the same small monster organ rewards for killing them and saving the victims.I found most the recipets to be near worthless against Boss Monsters which this game is loaded with.I give it a big thumbs up for young hard core fight gamers but for novice and children along with parents I suggest you find a game that is less violent as apparently children are shooting us after playing this lot of very violent games out now.If you are a hardcore gamer like the Game store employees are rent the game don't open the package and try to sell it off to me as new after you have used it or here. And remember some of us who are not serious gamers need the pamphlets and all the help we can get because our minds are different than yours we like to stop eat the apple, cook the meals, see the worlds all over Built by Nintendo and buy the Amiibos.I did not want to buy the game at the game store as I knew as hard as the employee tried to sell it to me \"new\" at a reduced price he had played it while off work and then brought it back repackaged it. Don't sell me a game think I don't know it is not new and do not change the name to new condition and then charge me illegally to my credit card for a used game especially when I know it is missing every single pamphlet that it comes with that gives information like you can use an Amiibo in the game.This game after all these years seems to still be a single player game which having the option for 2 to 4 player adventuring and fighting the huge monsters online or at home would surely be more entertaining.If I had paid full price I would be disappointed and stuck with a Used game. Rent these games first before buying if you can find a place to rent them. But so far I have put the Switch down sometimes for months like the Xbox One which has not been used in over a year as the PS3 controllers can be run wired not run out of battery power, run on the tv and the cherished but not mass produced PS vita system which still runs high used because of limited production and high popularity for the number produced.As I understand it is a loved Gamer hard core game I gave it a 5 starbut for me I give it as sit in the corner now for awhile if the horses are not able to be tamed and are programmed to run away from any sigh of trouble or into a big fight to kill you no in between the horses are crazy. So just walk through.If all you want to do is run to the end not enjoy the fabulous perk hard to tame and catch seriously wild horses that develop personality issues such after encountering Ogres and other monsters rent the game don't try to resell it to me as new as I buy new games also but as these sold out it has been difficult locally to find it not being resold as a new game when it is used also.",

All of us are approaching the game different ly and completing tasks in different ways. It is fun just. to immerse yourself in this world and get lost.

So I went into this with high hopes to begin with, then IGN rated the game a perfect 10, a masterpiece? Whoa....okay so is this the game that justifies me spending $300 for a new system?....by Nintendo?So, to answer those all in order....Yes, God Yes, and Hell Yes! This game is everything and more. As of writing this I’m a good 20-30hrs in and I feel like I’ve only scratched the surface. This game is insane and a love letter to anyone that looked up to a little hero named Link. First thing out of the gate are the graphics which are stunning. It’s a newer Windwaker type of grown up art? If that makes sense...anyway the cell shading and style are stunning. I have honestly sat there staring at the screen and just drinking up everything I see. The controls are tight but do getting some used to. That is more of my own personal learning curve then anything against the game. The story is engaging and makes you want to keep working to uncover more of it. I never felt like something was repetitive and each shrine challenge felt like I was getting something out of it and growing my character.  Overall I’ve been blown away. I knew this game was going to be fun, but I had no idea it would be as incredible as it is.  This game and Mario Odyssey are now two of my all time favorite games ever made and so make buying a new system totally worth it.",

    "review Text": "Easily one of the best Zelda games ever, and also the most difficult.  But that is a good thing, since I rarely ever died in other Zeldas.  In this one, you will probably die a lot, especially in the earlier stages before you get around to doing armor upgrades.  As the game progresses, you will die less, but it is still more challenging than any Zelda before or since.If there was 1 thing I wish they focused on more, it would probably be the storyline.  While the cutscenes are good, they are quite few and far between.  After you finish the Divine beasts, you will probably want to finish the shrines and upgrade armor before fighting Ganon.  At that point, there is a HUGE gap in story.  Ultimately, I wish there were something a little more linear.  I also wish all parts of the world could have been more connected story-wise.  Hopefully BotW II will focus a little more on this.All in all though, solid game and highly recommended.",

    "review Text": "Nintedo took kind of a \"less is more\" approach to some aspects of BOTW in my opinion. The less-is-more approach does not apply to the map, which is HUGE and the scenery is amazing. The dungeons do not follow the tried and true Zelda formula; solve puzzles in a dungeon, find a piece of gear that will help you, defeat the boss with the item, repeat. This is not a bad thing, there are no special items used to defeat bosses and the dungeons can be beaten in any order you want, you could even fight the end boss right away if you wanted, if you could get to him. There is a bit of nostalgia that Zelda fans will recognize, but the game doesn't get carried away with it nor does it distract from the game itself. The open world concept is nice albeit a bit overwhelming at first.Pros:- Big, beautiful map with a lot of nice scenery- A lot to do, many side quests mixed in with the main story- Holds on to what makes Zelda Zelda. Nintendo succeeds with some new concepts but doesn't completely deviate from the tried and true series modelHowever, there are cons:- RPG style, not necessarily a con, but you could get so powerful to the point the end boss will be incredibly underwhelming- The sword combat mechanics are clunky, so much so it feels like sword fighting was designed to be a secondary combat method, which is not the Legend of ZeldaThe cons are minor and shouldn't stop you from getting the game if you're thinking about it, I am a Zelda fanatic and I really like how this game fits into the Legend of Zelda series, still not my favorite (Link to the Past, Twilight Princess), but any Zelda fan will really enjoy this game.By the way, your gear will break, no way around it, get used to it.",

This is because of the Korok seeds that are spread throughout, which are only annoying to have to find all of them. I wouldn't call that not being empty...The trials are fun, but short. The beasts (dungeons) are laughably short and the boss fights are easy. The only bit of challenge comes in the form of unintuitive controls, which you cannot change (with the exception of swapping 2 inputs, run/jump I think).

However, you have to have enough free time to enjoy it. Prior to the corona shutdown I wouldn't have enjoyed this game at all because I was way to busy.  Instead, I stuck to games that allow for quick gameplay (e.g. Smash Bros, Mario Kart, etc).  As one review mentioned, you can spend a lot of time just travelling, and that is frustrating if you only have 30 min a day to play. I have tried to do most of the game on my own, but I have used a number of online videos to get through some parts since I don't have THAT much time :-)I have almost completed the game and am currently completing side missions before taking on the final boss.

The only real experience with The Legend of Zelda I had as a child was A Link to the Past, only recently didn't I get more into \"newer\" games, like Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, but Breath of the Wild does not even compare. Get ready to invest countless hours into exploring the vast expanses of the universe that Nintendo created for this newest Zelda title. I can play several gaming sessions solely exploring new areas I haven't explored. The combat, ill admit, took some getting used to, and there are some shortcomings to the combats aspects, which you will see for yourself once you start playing the game, but nothing that makes it not worth buying. So far the only downside is there aren't any of the classic gadgets like we used to have like the hookshot or big hammer, but, granted, I'm not very far into this game yet.

You may find a sword charged with the power of lightning, or a shield with extra strength to block incoming attacks.The storyline and unique characters are sure to keep your interest as you travel, meeting various races like the Ruto and the Zoras.

    "review Text": "Appropriate for kids and adults!!!!It had been many years since I played a Zelda game and this one was a must play! With the open world map. Awesome graphics. A good story line. Overall, anyone can pick up this game and play it as a stand alone without having played any of the other  Zelda games.While the story line progressed a little faster than your level could keep up (not exactly a leveling system but measured by how many hearts and amount of stamina you have) it was fairly streamlined. You just have to do a bit of grinding to find shrines and obtain orbs to get additional hearts or stamina in between each story piece. You also had to have 4 orbs to to trade for 1 heart or a quarter of stamina.As an RPG one thing I enjoyed was hunting down and finding the different clothing and armor items for Link to wear. With the addition of changing the coloring, I was able to find a look for Link that I liked, making him somewhat unique to me.The major downside to the game was the weapons. Every weapon had a limited number of uses to them. You could find a great sword or bow or spear that had great power. Unfortunately, after a few uses, *poof* it was gone! This left you scrambling to find as many weapons as you could. However, unless you collected enough Korok Seeds to trade to a creature and get more storage space, you would be very limited in the number of weapons and shields you could carry. Best strategy to combat this - download a map of all shrine and Korok Seed locations. You can place stamps all over the map of item locations. As you are working on clearing through an area or moving on to the next story point, mark the map of where the shrines and Korok Seeds are located and gather those as you go. This way you can trade these as you go along and quickly increase your hearts, stamina, and weapons cache, giving you a bit of an edge.Overall, it was a great game! With better weapon mechanics, I would have given this game a 5 Star review. I finally finished the story last week and I bought it in January (I don't get to play as much as I would like).",

The open-world nature lends greatly to hours upon hours of restless exploration. I personally am infatuated with exploration games, and I feel as though Breath of The Wild does an incredible job at giving the player a vast world to explore.2) Equipment durability is a pain in the butt! But it adds a layer of depth to the experience, requiring you to get tactical. Save your strongest weapons for the strongest enemies. A variety of weapons will save you. Varying materials will also save you. Few situations suck more than being stuck in a lightning storm with only metal shields, bows, and melee weapons. If you have no wooden equipment, prepare to have a bad day.3) Many conventional Zelda tropes are dropped, such as doing things in a specific order. This is similar to how A Link Between Worlds allowed you to tackle challenges in any order you desired.Those are the three most important points of this game, I think. An open world in which many previous tropes are cast aside and new mechanics give new challenges to a series that has been largely the same from iteration to iteration. That's it in one sentence.The short and skinny is this: If you are a fan of The Legend of Zelda, I think you owe it to yourself to play this game. Even if you find that it's not for you, you can at least say you gave it a fair chance.",

    "review Text": "I'll start this review by saying I've played a lot of Zelda games. As in nearly all of them, including any remakes and spin-offs. And while Breath of the Wild was groundbreaking in a lot of ways, I feel like it could have done better in certain aspects.Things I liked:The Open World - I absolutely loved the idea that you could run straight to Ganon if you so desired (and promptly get destroyed, but who cares?). And the fact that the world was so MASSIVE made it even more fun - there was always something undiscovered, something new with each and every playthrough. And the effects of the different areas, such as death by cold or heat, or weather conditions such as lightning, were awesome.The Monsters - the monsters were both challenging AND entertaining. I loved fighting them, and they were difficult enough that I've probably died more in this game than in any other Zelda game. I also really liked how they would react with certain weapons and situations, such as yelling at you in outrage if you stole their weapons, or would look around their surroundings for another item to throw at you (Moblins throwing other monsters, for example)The Clothes - I liked the styles for each individual outfit, and the benefits one could get if they fully upgraded them. However, in the end, I settled on making Link run around in nothing but his boxers for both the challenge and for the hilarity of it, but the fact that it's POSSIBLE makes it even better. Also the cross-dressing.Side-Quests - The sheer number of them was great, and some of the side missions (Pond of Love, anyone?) were hilarious and new.Cooking - the fact that you could forage, and create items that would heal you, or give you stealth boosts, or enhance your endurance, was new and a good addition to the game. No more having to rely on just four bottles! If you get hit and you're dying, you can eat fifty apples to get back on track (and you WILL get several hundred apples over the course of the game).Weapons - This is a love-hate relationship. I loved all the different weapons that you could get in the game, but I hated how QUICKLY they broke. Some of them were really cool/funny (The Castle Guard Series, the mops/brooms, the Lynel Weapons), but the fact that they broke so swiftly made getting them kind of pointless at times. And the fact that the Master Sword broke too was annoying, even if it recharged after a couple of minutes.The Divine Beasts - These are so COOL. I love the whole steampunk look, but also the fact that each divine beast has different functions and challenges made it more fun. And there were multiple ways to defeat the Blights, so what might work for some people wouldn't work for others.The Music - so simple and so soothing. The music itself is amazing, and perfectly sets the mood for the game. I especially liked the music for the Rito Village (and Revali's theme), Tarrey Town, and the Ganon battles. It's an excellent soundtrack, and it's not the first time I've wished that Zelda also released official albums for their games.Lack of a Companion - one thing that always irritated me about previous Zelda games was the annoying companion that followed you around (Midna being the only exception from Twilight Princess). But in this game, there's none of that, which is really nice.Master Mode - SO HARD. It forces you to be creative in some of your fights, and it made me angry enough to rage quit on the Master Sword DLC, which I've never done before. Basically, it's very challenging.Things I didn't like:The Shrines - There are 120 of them, and some of them are trial by combat, some of them are puzzles, and some of them are memory-based with no hope of remembrance (Dueling Peaks, I'm looking at you). They were fun at first, but after a while, they got exhausting. But unfortunately, they're necessary if you want more hearts and stamina. The only shrine I really, absolutely liked, was the one on Eventide Island, because Survival Man is my jam. Honestly, I wish they had a couple of traditional Zelda dungeons thrown in with the shrines - it would have made the game much better in my opinion.The Weapons - as mentioned aboveThe Korok Seeds - there are over 800 of these mofos scattered around the map. EIGHT HUNDRED. And there's a limit as to how much you can expand your weapon/shield/bow stash, even if you DO find all 800 of them, which makes a good majority of the Korok seeds useless. If there were like 200 of these to find, I probably wouldn't have been so aggravated trying to find them all, but no, there's over 800 and there's no point for most of them.The Story - one thing I've greatly enjoyed about the Zelda series is the story. And while BOTW does offer one, it's a little...lacking. The only thing I really enjoyed about it was the development of Zelda's character, which was the only substantial part of the story. There's too many things to do, and not enough story to support it. Just quick little flashbacks that almost feel like afterthoughts. I don't mind the whole memory loss thing, I just wish there was more to the plot of the game.The Voice Acting - Don't get me wrong, I love how they even HAD voice acting in the first place. I just wish they picked BETTER voice actors. The only ones I liked were Urbosa, Mipha, and Revali. The others...not so much.Calamity Ganon - they build him up as the big bad, the one you MUST defeat, the hardest villain of all...and then it's a disappointment. The only time it got difficult for me was when it teleported me into the field with my horse, and I happened to have Ganon's giganto horse with me at the time, which unfortunately can't sprint.Overall, I really liked the game - while some parts were lacking, it was very different compared to other, more traditional Zelda games. It's very easy to get sucked into it and to lose months of your life to it. And I would recommend the DLCs. They're not super expensive, and they add more challenge and bonuses to the game, as well as more story (and what feels like an actual Zelda dungeon and boss fight!). So Four out of Five Stars.",

Before Breath of the Wild, the bulk of my experience with the LoZ series came from Link's Awakening on the original Game Boy.With that being said, those who feel right at home with open world games, where exploration takes a central role in the adventure, will feel at home with the latest entry in the Zelda franchise.  It never feels too overwhelming, which is a good thing because this entry introduces a lot of new elements that players of previous Zelda games have never encountered in this franchise before.  It is a stunningly beautiful game, one that is meant to be explored at one's own pace.  Similar to Skyrim and other open world games, the main quest can be ignored and completed at one's leisure.  There are plenty of areas to explore, tons of secrets and hidden things to find, and loads of side quests to take on and solve.",

    "review Text": "I feel truly compelled to write a review for breath of the wild as a veteran of nearly every other Zelda game previously released.  This review contains content spoilers in reference to what you can expect when you play the game, but doesn't contain any story or plot spoilers.For the first five days I had this game, I logged over 48 hours.  I lived, dreamed (literally), and thunk breath of the wild and I could not get enough.Then, after about getting half way through the main quest (there are minor side quests), I found myself seriously struggling to proceed further in the game.Let me break it down:1. The good.This game has outstanding graphics by comparison of other Zelda games.  The open world environment is a fantastic experience that gives you universal freedom to do whatever you want, the entire scope of Hyrule is open to you immediately.  Each corner of the map is an entirely different environment that is also athletically unique.  The jungles have immense amounts of waterfalls to explore, Death Mountain has rocks you can mine, the desert has hills that stretch for miles, and Hyrule field is a largely open area where the possibilities are endless.The greatest new feature of this game is Links ability to climb basically anything that is in his/your way.  You could spend an entire day just doing this, see a mountain in the distance?  All you have to do is get to the base and have at it, (it's a little more technical than this) and this aspect opens up Hyrule in a way never seen before.  The game also contains various side quests which give the title a bit more depth than in the past where it is A) Find Zelda. B) Get Master Sword. C) Restore power to Master Sword. D) Kill Ganon/ Ganondorf2. The bad.Like I said earlier, this game gets old, fast.  This is because the things that you have to do in the game to truly advance your character (gain heart containers and the new stamina vessels), are extremely repetitive.  The new Shrine system tasks Link with completing small puzzles of different natures all over the map (these locations also serve as fast travel points) and each shrine takes between 5-20 minutes on average.  You gain \"Spirit Orbs\" which you then exchange for Heart Containers or Stamina Vessels.  This is very different than traditionally, as you either collected \"Pieces of Hearts\" or gained Heart Containers through boss battles.  There are 120 shrines in total, and after about 50, you find yourself having to force yourself to complete them.Another new aspect is the multiple sets of armor, shields, bows, and melee weapons Link can use; BUT most importantly: Weapon Durability.  This is a pivotal complaint among those who have critiqued this game from a slightly negative aspect, as a weapons durability (while variable) really only seem to last for about 3-4 monster encounters.  You constantly find yourself weighing if its worth wasting a very rare weapon you find on weaker level enemies, because you know in your mind it WILL break, and succumb to using multiple weaker-weapons you find very early in the game saving that one special sword or shield for the few large scale monster encounters you do have.Likewise, the armor you find has stat boosting abilities (increased sneak, increased climbing speed, or heat resistance) and you find yourself changing armor on the fly multiple times every couple of minutes depending on what it is that you are doing.  While not as bad as the issue of weapon durability, it invariably becomes a chore.3. The ugly.This games ultimate downfall is the elimination of what made the classical Zelda games, Zelda games.  From turning the recovery of the Master Swords into an option (be it that the game highly recommends it), to the fact that you don't have the ability to use Links stereotypical green armor until you complete an achievement that spans the entire game, it felt like while they kept Link in name, they stripped him of everything that made him who we recognize.To further build on this, the game has eliminated another core element of what made The Legend of Zelda, well, The Legend of Zelda: Dungeons.  IIm not kidding, BOW does not contain a single dungeon other than the very, very last steps of the game. Instead, there is the Shrine system (not attached to any sort of quest, but is essential if you want more than three hearts), as well as a few \"large puzzles\" that take you through the main quest.  I'll leave it to reader interpretation as to what that means for boss battles. . .With the removal of dungeons, Link also looses his access to the tools that he would gain throughout the series in previous titles.  The hook-shot, iron boots, ball & chain ect. are non-existent.  While the replacement system of the Runes is a decent attempt by Nintendo to reconcile this, it felt cheap and frankly?  They're boring to use, and almost useless in combat.To finally end what now feels like a nostalgic rant, the variety of monsters in BOW is the smallest variation you could hope for.  Honestly, there are about four different types of \"grunt level\" monsters you encounter throughout the entire game, three larger sub-variants of these same smaller monsters, and two beasts that actually pose a series threat to you throughout the game.  BOW instead utilizes a color system to differentiate the difficulty they present (Red, Blue, Black, and sometimes Silver) , and instead of having a large scope of monsters throughout the game- you encounter the same monsters from the start of the game, through the very end.I really hate to be the debby downer.  Especially when it comes to the foundational game that developed my love for video games, but this game didn't feel like a true Zelda title.  It felt like it wanted to take the successful plot line which has kept me a fan for years and apply that to a different games world.  If I had to deal with only \"the bad\" I think I could at least give this game four stars, the only reason I can give it three is because those first five hours were exhilarating.

I can honestly say I enjoyed this game, played it every day to completion and was invested enough to get the best ending completely by accident on the first playthrough, but the story, ultimately, is a little weak and relies heavily on tropes and bad character archetypes; you will hate the voice acting, but love the character design.

Not really anything new for modern Zelda, just very disappointing. Also, the ost is disappointing. I legitimately can't remember a single song, as it goes for ambient music. Even boss battle music doesn't stick out. Weapon durability is also a pain, as every weapon breaks insanely quickly. Sure, it gives you plenty to work with, as enemies drop weapons even before they die, it's just irritating to deal with.All in all, I enjoyed my experience with the game, but I honestly wouldn't call it one of the best games of all time, nor even the best Zelda game.

I think they should leave the open world games to the dozens of other games, and stick to making more of a “game�?and less of a “real world�?Fighting enemies is pretty fun and feels good (almost feels \"Souls\"ish, but after a while I didn’t even care to engage enemies anymore, as there wasn’t any benefit. Since there is no XP gained or any drops that are actually beneficial, there’s really no reason to battle once you’re past a certain point.Completing shrines became a chore after a while, and many were not very challenging. They really should have reduced the number, and made more “dungeons�? or other random experiences where you could gain an orb.I really miss classic Zelda dungeons.Though the glider and climbing ability are cool , I feel like they caused me to miss a lot of the game. I would just glide and climb everywhere and not really experience much. When I just decided to run everywhere, it was a much more immersive experience.The “island�?was a great surprise and experience.Cooking is super cool. Not having a “cookbook�?is not.Using the Wolf Link Amiibo is cool, but it’s super annoying having to constantly scan it. They should have just built the wolf into the base game.

It went very much beyond the high expectations I had for it, especially considering my long history with the Legend of Zelda series.The best part of the game easily comes down to the engagement the player has with the environment. Pretty much anything that's around you can be engaged with. A bird in the background? Shoot it with your motion-controlled bow and collect it's meat to then cook it in the game's complex cooking system. Hear a cricket? Find it in the beautifully rendered fields and combine it with other materials to make elixirs. The list is practically endless with the countless amount of activities that you can get yourself lost in.From climbing any visible cliff or mountain, to exploring the world for the 120 puzzle-based dungeons or the 900 hidden Koruk seeds (used for inventory expansion), Breath of the Wild captures everything you could hope for. The graphical design of the game had me stunned when I first opened it. The typically peaceful music that plays as you explore the massive world of Hyrule creates an incrediblly unique experience. Because there are too many things that I can list to praise this wonderful game, I'll conclude by saying that if you want to satisfy any kind of entertainment you're looking for in today's era, pick up and play the hundreds of hours to come on the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.",

    "review Text": "I just wanted to update my review for the game. There's no doubt this game deserves a 5 star score. It's bold and Nintendo created a world that's bigger than any game to date. I want to point out that I did beat the game and completed most of the dungeons that are spread out throughout the game. I'm sure by now you've heard all the good and great things about the game, but there should be the negative as well.  First, I did not like how Nintendo undermined the weapon system. Weapons and shields break too often. How does this effect the game? You're travelling the vast land, yet you feel reluctant to fight the moblins and goblins because you don't know if it will be worth it for your item to break. Even \"unbreakable\" items can wear out and need time to recharge.  Second, if Nintendo wanted to make the travelling worth while combat and fighting should reward you. Sure there are items and chests to gain if you take over a moblin base, but the items are often not worth it. I would see someone trying to make the case that you need to battle enemies to gain their parts to upgrade armor, but once you upgrade, fighting becomes pointless. There's no experience gained or leveling up, so why not just run away most of the time. I have played Horizon Zero Dawn and in my opinion, HZD's battles felt more Zelda-like than Botw. The weapons and items in HZD seemed to have more value than BOTW. Enemies take more strategy to beat in HZD and every weapon had a purpose to defeating an enemy with a weakness to it. I'm not saying HZD is a better game or BOTW is a better game mind you. I'm not trolling Zelda, I gave it a 5 star score. For those who played both games, you will see what I am talking about with the enjoyment of battles in HZD.  Third, bosses have been simplified. You do not need a special item or much strategy to beat the bosses. In past Zelda's the dungeon's secret item would be the weakness to the boss. But in BOTW all you need is a strong weapon and armor to beat bosses. The bosses were not overly creative. Each boss was only marginally different from the previous.  Where are the iconic items? Where is the boomerang, the hookshot,, heavy boots, bug net, fairy bottles, etc, etc. Items were a central theme in all the Zeldas. Why did they take that out? It was one of the biggest surprises or exciting parts of previous games when opening a chest. Putting value into items is something I would like to see reinstated in future games.  Fourth, the epic field music is gone and replaced by a subtle piano and atmospheric tunes. In all of the previous Zeldas, I would be either humming or whistling tunes from Zelda for days after I had finished. Yes, the game does have one theme that reoccurs when something important happens or when you beat a boss, or when you find a stable, but not a very memorable soundtrack.  Fifth, many of the side quests do not have much bearing on the actual main story. Sure, some side quests in the game will help you gain helpful items and armor, but it does not change the ending or how NPC will react to you. Since Nintendo wanted to take a page from the western rpg genre, decision making should have been impactful to the outcome of the game. POTENTIAL SPOILER--->From what I know there are two endings to the game and I have gotten both by visiting all the specific areas in the game that's part of a side quest.  Sixth, does bigger mean better? In the case that there are 120 mini dungeons in the game, they had to make the world bigger to fit them, but in my opinion, making the world so large made things a little tedious. Sure, there is fast travel, but getting to each location seemed a little bit of a chore especially since fighting enemies was not rewarding, and other than finding mini dungeons and moblin bases, there was nothing much to do. I don't consider hunting or gathering foods that much of reason for the large map.  In no way am I bashing Zelda. In fact, I do believe it deserves to be the game of the year. Even with what I consider as flaws, the good outweigh the negative greatly. I just hope Nintendo can take some advice from their fans to improve the next installment.",

    "review Text": "To be blunt, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is arguably the best Zelda game ever made and it's definitely the most ambitious. Nintendo has outdone themselves, you have to hand it to them. There is very little negative to say about this game. Let's do a break down of the pros and cons.Pros:+Best Zelda story to date. Yes, it may be the same premise, but there is much more depth this time around. There are other things going on, not just Link rescuing Zelda. All of the side quests add so much to the main story. The depth is what makes the game succeed.+Voice acting adds a lot to some of the characters we already know and love, including Zelda herself. It makes for a richer and more interesting story.+Gameplay is king in Zelda games. We all know this. BOTW is no different. There is a ton of gameplay variety, more than there has ever been. Everything from fighting, exploring, cooking, transportation, it's all been either improved or newly introduced.+Open World and Exploration are front and center in BOTW. The open world design allows you take whatever path you choose. While most Zelda games in the past were linear, this is not the same. Whatever approach you prefer is completely fine. The freedom really shines through in BOTW.+The beautiful art style makes up for anything lacking in the graphics department. The Wii U and Switch are not on par with the PS4 and Xbox One, so don't expect that type of beauty, but the art style truly does make a big difference. Nintendo has always been king when it comes to gorgeous art and design. Exploration is one of the game's biggest draws. Conquering the 100+ shrines is amazing!+Wii U and Switch versions offer choice for the gamer. You don't have to upgrade to the Switch to experience BOTW. The Wii U version is every bit as great as the Switch one. In fact, I owned the Switch version but got rid of it in favor of the Wii U version. I did not see the point in upgrading since the only other Switch game I care about is Mario Odyssey and that doesn't come out for almost another year.+More than 100 hours of gameplay offers major value (in your wallet) and replay value. There is always something to see and do!+The game world is absolutely huge. This lends itself to many hours of fun, whether you are doing side quests, the main quests, shrines, or goofing off.+Challenging and thought provoking puzzles are a standout in BOTW. Every shrine has a challenging puzzle, while most boss battles require you to solve a puzzle as well.+Cooking is really fun. Doing recipes is a blast, just experimenting with food can be an interesting distraction.+Great A.I., from the main characters, townsfolk and enemies.+Use the Wii U Pro controller for the best experience. It is more tight and comfortable than the GamePad. I don't have experience with the Switch Pro Controller (probably because it's $70!) but I am sure it's superior to the Joy-Cons and Grip.Cons:-Weapons break a lot, maybe too much. I found that a lot of my time was devoted to changing weapons, whether in a battle or not. It's not a game-breaker but it is an annoyance.Overall, Zelda BOTW is an all time great. It's a game you must experience and have in your collection. I bought the Wii U version, but the choice is yours. Go out and buy it to experience something you will never forget!",

The game is beautifully done. It is easily one of the best games I have ever played. This game isn’t just about finishing it and beating the boss and seeing what happens next, it’s an experience in itself. It’s a whole world that feels alive and quirky and very explorable. I feel as though it has tons of replayability. Many people say that the story is lacking but I don’t believe that to be the case.

Though I must say it may have too much open space because with this huge vast open world game it tends to feel almost too big with enemies being sometimes way to far apart of way to close together, unless you get a horse you will find yourself running around all over the place to the point they might have just implemented a Pokémon go thing in there (I'm sorry about that).Combat can be a little dull at the beginning since advanced combat training isn't taught until later in the game (because now these days games just don't come with manuals anymore like the old days)I must say though weapon breaking which is highly in this game tends to be annoying and you'll often find yourself breaking your 12 damage sword and then have to use a 6 damage club that you picked up from the dead enemy you just broke your sword on until later in the game.Grinding and collecting materials for food that you can cook or monster parts you use to create elixir is something that is fun to experiment but can also be annoying and it's highly encouraged you bring foods that can heal you up faster.As for gameplay it's a solid 5/5 stars, not once have I had lag issues or freezing and not even frame drops has happened to meThough as any Zelda fan knows they would agree that this game does break some old Zelda tradition such as the weapon breaking, another is how in past Zelda games you were able to name yourself but in here you don't get that option.I love this game and can't get enough of it and I would highly encourage getting this game (especially over the 1-2 switch game)",

It's vast in scope, both in terms of environments to explore, and in terms of gameplay possibilities - abilities, items, ways to use things, mini-games, etc. It combines good elements from some of my favorite games of the past, such as Shadow of the Colossus and Final Fantasy. Overall I'd say the individual game elements are not new, and I'm not a super-fan of the Hyrule universe, but with elements of many great things combined together into a huge open world, it's probably the most versatile game ever made.",

    "review Text": "edit: Sorry this turned into a long review. There's actually more I wanted to mention but it's already too long.I really wanted to give this 5 stars but couldn't quite get there.I'm not really sure how to frame this review. I'll try and make it generic and not have any plot spoilers. I played this game at least once a day for about 6 weeks (march 11th - april 24th). I don't know of a way to see an official our count but guessing I would say between 150 and 250 hours - when I did finally beat it - I did do a lot of optional things though. Also, I only played it almost entirely with the pro controller\" and a little bit with the Switch in portable-console-mode. Never used the detachable wireless controllers as a controller. I usually got around 2 1/2 - 3 hours as a portable by the way.I'll preface this by saying the last zelda i finished was Ocarina, 20 years ago. Haven't really kept up with Nintendo or zelda since then. Maybe some old zeldas through emulation. Still have TP and skyward sword on my \"to do list\".What would someone like me associate with a zelda game? A big over world with at least 8 dungeons of varying amounts of difficulty finding them, locked off areas that aren't accessible until certain items are found (like hookshot, the higher strength bracelet and the boomerang) and of course dungeons that include keys, a compass and a map.Well this zelda has a twist and that idea: instead of 8 fairly large dungeons and areas locked away until you get certain items...there's 120 relatively short shrines only four of which are required to complete the game. And there aren't really areas locked away until you get a specific item. Maybe an area is extremely difficult with only 3 hears and no stamina but it's not physically impossible to get there.This being an \"open world\" game I can't help but compare to other games of that kind, the freshest on my mind being the elder scrolls games. Skyrim for instance had weapon forging, marriages, a whole magical system, an economics system...far and away more complex than and in-depth than this in other words. But that's the way I have always remembered Zelda games: an \"RPG\" but much more \"accessible\" to kids and players who may not want to spend hundreds of hours doing everything. Actually if you were going to make an elder scrolls comparison Oblivion would be the most obvious in comparison (as I recall it had a lot of ...I want to say oblivion gates..that were optional to beat).In BotW you don't really \"level up\" and there isn't actually an experience system.  You finish shrines to get spirit orbs and then you upgrade either stamina (how long you can go before stopping to rest) or hearts (hit points). In other words you don't specialize in different skill sets. You can cook the best meal there is from the word go if you know the recipe and where to get the ingredients. And the same with archery and weapons skills: you don't get better and better at spears if you specialize in them, it's the same from the first moment as it is at the final fight. And I kind of like that.Over the course of my play through I went through several stages:1. starting the game, learning the controls, finding shrines and not towers with sheika slate scope, running from bokoblins...2. blowing myself up with bombs, continually crouching while trying to run away from mini-bosses, seeing that game over screen a lot3. being addicted to seeing what's over the next horizon, what's over there, staying up until 3am on a work night. This is probably the peak of the experience.4. having uncovered the whole map, having to track down those final shrines and finishing the side quests5. The final stage is kind of...frustrating. I didn't want to finish yet but there wasn't much left to do. The main point of side quests is get either money or \"mad loot\". But at some point I had \"four-starred\" my favorite armor and had 26k rupees so that kind of took away the motivation. So it was more \"farming mini bosses\" to get the ingredients and high level weapons I needed.So I would say you reach \"peak botw\" around 12 hearts with two divine beasts under your belt.What are the cons?- As mentioned before, I kept crouching and very inconvenient times. The analog stick that is used for movement/running, when pushed down, makes Link crouch. This frustrated me to know end. I really wish there was a \"disable crouch\" option, even if temporary. Would made things so much easier.- the technology used for the game is kind of...not powerful enough. For instance animals (or lizards) will run away and then simply disappear. For instances and dear will be right in front of me running circles and then just fade away right in front of me. I find this annoying. As is the sand seals and that can't pull me over rocks but can dive into rocks as if they were sand. It just seems like a lack of attention to detail or...maybe just a flaw in the technology. Really takes me out of the immersion.- The music. Or rather lack thereof. There's a appropriate sounds when something is chasing after Link or there's a mini-boss in the area. But a lot of times it's either generic ambient music or no music at all, just wind blow through trees. I realize Nintendo isn't on forefront of technology but if you're really going to leave out music how about some way of importing custom music? Pandora? Something? Probably too much to ask.- Even with the latest patch (as of april 25th 2017) I get some frame rate issues (I played with it on the dock/connected to a TV 99% of the time). Not very often and I don't remember it actually affecting game play. But that doesn't make it any less annoying.- I have the physical version of the game and sometimes those loading times kind of get to me. Feels like I'm in the early 90s waiting for my 1x CD ROM to load.  I did get a lot of tips for the loading screens, but I would still rather have faster loading.Neutral:- The weapon system. I think I figured out what they were going for: since there is no crafting or repair system for weapons and shields, this is the way the game upgrades your effectiveness. As you complete shrines and divine beasts the weapons slowly improve. Actually the enemies not all of them) slowly upgrade as well to be more difficult, thereby dropping improved weapons. It's supposed to be an organic thing, which it is up to a certain point.- the motion controls: technically they \"work\" but I didn't appreciate them for things like aiming the bow so the first thing I did was turn them off. There are still shrines that make you use them though.- the plot: not over the top great, no great twists or anything. Just a pretty straight forward thing. It's kind of like the plot of the movie \"the blues brothers\" now that I think about it. Link is \"getting the band back together\" for one last gig. And also bailing someone out of tough situation. Except link doesn't have a partner, it's just him trying to talk people into fighting again coming to the aid somebody. It's actually pretty impressive the way they pieced the plot together through these \"memories\" that are entirely optional and can be watched in any order yet still fits together into a cohesive whole by the end.- optional quests and mini-games. To expand your inventory capacity (for melee weapons/bows/shields) you have to trade in korok seeds. You find korok seeds but searching out of the way places for things that \"seem out of place\". Like a circle of rocks obviously missing a piece to make a full circle. Complete the circle, get a seed. Collect enough seeds and trade them for more inventory capacity. So you explore the world, solve some minor puzzles and in trade you \"earn\" more inventory space. It seems fair (I found just under 200 seeds, which sounds like a lot until you find out there's 900 total). There's also a take-a-pic-of-everything mini game thing. I was wondering at the start why there was no central repository explaining all the various enemies. And then I got the thing that allowed for photo taking. So it's \"build-your-own beastiary\". I don't know that there's a reward for a complete repository. But it is helpful. There's also some other mini-games like gliding for the longest and riding a shield down a snow path. Those are fun more than anything.- the way the monsters (and most everything else) re-spawns: I think I like it. I mean it's kind of explained in the context of the plot and it's relatively predictable. I once got stuck on a certain island the night before that re-spawn event. It was like living through \"groundhog day\" having to beat the island multiple times to try and finish it. In the \"late game\" you may start to plan all your adventures around the next re-spawn.Positives:- It is a very compelling open world. I spent many a night exploring random areas, trying to finish puzzles in shrines and fighting various mini bosses. It's often hard to put down.- the gained abilities from the start of the game makes it very fun to experiment. And the shrines make you \"think outside the box\" in your creative use of these abilities to solve the puzzle.- speaking of abilities, almost always when i couldn't figure out puzzle the answer seemed to be \"use crynosis\" (giant pillar of ice). Not sure why I had so much trouble remembering that was a thing.- I actually like a lot of the mini bosses. The Hinox (giant one-eyed things that seem to enjoy sleeping) were intimidating at first but eventually quite fun to fight. And a good source of relatively high power bows. Among other things.- the recipe/cooking system. I still don't know all the super-great recipes by name/by heart. But I know enough the create enhancements for speed/stealth/heart recovery/recovery+extra hearts/attack up/defense up/recover stamina/extra stamina wheels. And that's what I really want anyway. Never did figure out what good all those blocks of salt are for. Guess that's why I have hundreds of them.- I like the logic of the game. For instance in the starter area is a required shrine but the area is too cold to go through without losing hearts. You only have three hearts so this is rather important. There are hints of a recipe that will provide cold resistance as well as a way to get a warm vest. But I didn't know how to cook or that the \"warm doublet\" was an option. So as is probably logical i used a torch to provide just enough warmth to get through the cold area. Of course there are also bad guys to get through along the way and the torch goes out when you switch to a weapon so then you have to find some place to re-light a torch. You can also light wood weapons on fire of course. And actually where you start finding element enhanced weapons this works the same way: in the hot desert equip a great ice sword to stay a little cooler (and a fireblade to stay a little warmer). There's also things like ice-based enemies that die in one hit with a fire weapon, and fire enemies that die from ice weapons. Just makes sense.- Actually, you indirectly learn how to do with lightning strikes pretty quickly (if you have metal weapons equipped you'll likely get struck by lightning). And this knowledge comes in handy with the electricity-based puzzles (metal weapons conduct electricity). As does water. Comes in handy for disabling groups of enemies standing in water.- It seems like for every \"that's not fair\" element you find there is a \"that's very generous of you\" element to counter it. For instance it's not at all difficult to stumble across an enemy entirely over your head in abilities/hit points/etc. and can insta-kill you without much more than a look. As if to counter this you have the transportation/beam out ability you get pretty much first thing. At any moment/any time you can bring up the map and warp away without any consequences of any kind. About to drown? Or part way up a mountain and out of stamina? Laser about the take your head off? No problem, bring up the map and warp away. Doesn't cost any rupees or hearts or anything nor are there restrictions around enemies being around etc. Insta-gone.- the armor system: lets just say collect everything you see that you can pick up. Every much room, every firefly, every apple, every horn. Because you will need it, and I don't think there's any sort of limit to how big that stack of teeth can get (or I didn't find the limit, anyway). You'll need it to upgrade your armor, which you will want to do for the \"set bonus\". There's the fireproof suit for walking around on death mountain without instantly catching on fire. There's the rock climbing suit for super fast climbing, there's the sheika outfit for super-stealth, there also one for extreme cold and extreme heat. The one that allows for walking around inside in a volcano doesn't help for traveling in the desert. Not sure why. Point is you will probably want that extreme cold outfit upgrade so you're \"unfreezable\" and the rubber suite upgraded so your \"unshockable\". And extreme heat one so you're not dressed as...well lets not spoil the surprise.- the combat system: the sooner you learn the parry/super dodge system the better off you'll be. Took me forever to get the hang of it. But it's definitely worth it. Lets just say you can kill the guardians in the starter area with nothing more than a pot lid...How much one likes this game I think will be directly proportional to how open one is to open world games (like the elder scrolls series). I never had any trouble figuring out where to go or what to do next in this game (and Impa is there to remind you). The plot is entirely optional as are the \"divine beasts\" and 116 of 120 shrines. You can waste time time and do whatever you want in any random order you like. That's either terrifyingly flexible or wonderfully freeing, depending on your tastes. Think of it as a really watered down version of all the famous open world franchises. Which isn't a bad thing.One tip to leave you with: that area around Zora's domain, the long windy road with all the lizard men, that is definitely the place for gathering arrows. And you will run low on arrows...a lot. I was doing that every re-spawn time for a while there.",

You can do as little or as much as you want. It’s your world.The Good Stuff:Gameplay. This is the best 3D Zelda game to date. I got the itch to replay Twilight Princess HD and realized you can never go back.The graphics. Breath of the Wild looks great on the Switch and feels like a truer sequel to Xenoblade Chronicles for the Wii/3DS than Xenoblade Chronicles X on the Wii U (Which is an awful game). While the Wii U version suffers from low framerate during many parts (even after the patch), the Switch version doesn't seem to have any issues.Music. Since this game is all about atmosphere, Nintendo decided to go with a softer, more subtle background music for most of the game. There is also various music for different areas, but not as catchy as previous Zelda games.No handholding. The game doesn't treat you like you've never played a video game before. While there is a \"tutorial\" section at the start, it feels very natural.Voice Acting. This is the first Zelda game to feature voice acting but it's used lightly. You're still going to click through tons of text adjoined by grunts and groans.The Bad Stuff:Tediousness. You will be finding/hunting food and other items. You must cook your food to make hearts and elixirs using recipes. It’s all trial and error. You will have to constantly find new weapons, shields, and bows as they all break. You will need to upgrade slots to hold more of these items. Lastly, you must increase your hearts AND stamina. Menus and item selection are all over the place and very confusing to use. You can access a weapons menu 2 different ways, but only one allows you to drop them. Why not both? They really needed to work more on this.Controls. Those tiny joycons simply don't cut it as a handheld controller. I'm constantly accidently pushing on the control stick when trying to move around the camera during a battle (causing me to zoom in instead). The position of the right stick is also not very ideal. I finally got a Pro Controller and everything is much better.Voices. Obviously adding voices to a Zelda game is going to be controversial. Zelda Cdi anyone? While Link doesn't talk for some reason, almost everyone is well voiced except for Mipha (Zora Princess). She's awful. Luckily, the others aren't so bad. A lot of people complain about Zelda, but I find her to be acceptable.Overall, if you're a Zelda fan there is a whole world to discover and enjoy. You can spend 60+ hours playing around and still not even start the main storyline. Or, you can just jump right into the story and finish it as quickly as you choose. The game is completely open and allows you to play it however you see fit.",

Also moving and firing the slate runes are done with the same thumb, which is very inconvenient. Very pretty game, fun to explore everywhere until I run into something far above what I can handle and have no idea that I can't handle it. I keep dying, which is mostly my own fault when it's not because of the issues mentioned above, but it is difficult to know how hard an enemy will hit, so sometimes it's a major surprise when all the hearts are gone.

If you're a Zelda fan then it's a must buy as it expands on the Zelda formula in great ways. My only gripe is the small usage of motion controls in a few portions of the game (a few shrines and the bow aiming although you can disable bow aiming motion controls, but not the shrines where you have to use motion controls). I always play my Switch in docked mode so can't say how it compares docked vs undocked and I also use a pro-controller so can't say how playing with the default controller stacks up. This is definitely going to be the definitive Zelda game from thus point forward ... unless they somehow combine the best of WindWaker with BOTW then I'd be in heaven.",

I'm a huge fan of open world games in general, so it already had that going for it, but I honestly thought it did just about everything right.Visuals:  Absolutely beautiful.  The world is incredibly colorful and beautifully rendered.  The character designs are lively and do a fantastic job of evoking their original iterations from prior games with a new flair and visual appeal (I said I didn't put any 'serious' effort into the old games, not that I hadn't played them).Sound/Music:  Also beautiful.  Updated takes on classic sounds and tunes melding perfectly with some newly orchestrated pieces.  The voice acting is a little 50/50, but the ones that do a good job (like the actress voicing Zelda) are FANTASTIC and the others are nod BAD per se, just kinda goofy, like saturday morning cartoon goofy.Story:  Waaaaay better than I expected.  The memories you unlock of Link and Zelda's past are quite well written.  Some of the side characters are your standard character archetypes, but nothing too cheesy.Controls:  I would probably take a half point off for the horse riding and the countering mechanics.  Those are harder to use than I feel they should have been.  Personally, I just never used a horse and did more dodging that blocking, so it evened out.  Everything else is really solid.  Combat, movement, inventory management, all fluid and intuitive.I'd give this a solid 9/10 (rounded up to 5 stars)",

    "review Text": "Wow, who would have thought that after thirty incredible years of Zelda, with some of the best and most critically acclaimed games ever, Nintendo would manage to create what is, hands down, the best Zelda game to date in the form of “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.�? A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, Majora’s Mask, it is time to step aside.  The Zelda series has a new champion.  Breath of the Wild is a Masterpiece, and feels destined to be a classic.The Legend of Zelda series is, I must admit, my favorite video game series of all time (which is my favorite past-time) I have been absolutely obsessed with Zelda since I first played Ocarina of Time at the age of ten, sometimes obsessed to a rather unhealthy degree.  I have loved every Zelda game, and especially every 3D Zelda, though none of them quite captured the same feeling of wonder and exploration.  Until very recently, I would rank Ocarina of Time as my favorite video game of all time, but it looks as though that mantle is finally being passed to another game.  Breath of the Wild feels like the Zelda game Nintendo has always wanted to make, but hasn’t been able to do to technological constraints or what have you.  This game feels like the essence of what Zelda is, and always has been, about.  While this is a lengthy review, this is a game that warrants such a lengthy review.Story:  The story to this game begins in a place called the chamber of resurrection.  Our hero, Link, has been asleep in a form of stasis for 100 years.  When he awakes, he finds the land of Hyrule in ruins, starting with the desolate Temple of Time on the Great Plateau, the starting location.  Link is told by a voice in his head that he must be the light to shine upon the land of Hyrule.  After meeting a mysterious old man (throwback to the original Zelda game there) Link sets out on his quest to save Hyrule from the evil monster inside Hyrule Castle, known as the Calamity Ganon.  Without spoiling too much of this story, I will only say that it is probably the most cinematic Zelda story to date.  The fact that this game has voice acting, which is a first for the Zelda series, adds a lot of weight to the key story moments.  The characters feel far more fleshed out, and they feel genuinely human.  This game’s version of the titular princess Zelda might be the most relatable and interesting incarnation of the character to date, as she has genuine depth to her character.  The other pivotal characters also feel uniquely more fleshed out as well, providing some of the most memorable story cut-scenes in a Zelda game, or any Nintendo game.  Though Wind Waker and Skyward Sword might rival it, this is probably the best Zelda story to date.  It does a great job of immersing you into the Gameplay and the world itself.  Moreover, as you explore the world, you feel as though a story is being told through the exploration itself.  One of the ingenious methods to the story-telling in this game is how it is told in a nonlinear nature, meaning that you can track down different pieces of the story in any order, and still have it all make sense in the end.  Parts of the story are also optional, so it doesn’t ever feel like it’s spoon-fed to you, which is a good thing.Presentation:  Right off the bat, I must say that Breath of the Wild is one of the most Gorgeous looking games that has ever been made to me.  The simple, soft and vibrant colors also contain a hidden elegance and sophistication that can convey lots of emotion both in terms of story and Gameplay.  The style feels reminiscent of Skyward Sword’s, which I also adored, but taken to the next level.  This is the first Zelda title to be made in HD, and it shows.  The character designs are flawless, and unforgettable.  The stunning lighting effect, particularly when the sun rises and sets, remain beautiful to watch from start to finish, and the whole game just looks fantastic.  This is magnified on the Nintendo Switch, with longer draw distances and a better performance overall than the Wii U version.  There were still some frame-rate drops during moments in the game, particularly during battle moments against the Moblin enemies.  While the frame-rate hiccups are still noticeable on the Switch, the game runs noticeably better overall.  This minor complaint never ruined the game, or the immersion for me.I for one love the choice of music in this game.  The subtle but brilliant use of piano cords make the world feel more natural and organic, and is contrasted brilliantly with the high-energy guardian themes and shrine theme.  This, in a way, helps the thematic element of nature versus technology play out in its sound design.  While the music may not be something you would listen to outside of the game in the same way you would with previous Zelda games, I believe the music and sound design is perfect for this game.  That said, the horse riding theme, Hateno village, and Hyrule Castle are amazing pieces. The Hateno Village theme is simple and beautiful.  The voice acting is also very solid, and I would love to see future Zelda games expand on it even more.What it comes down to is that the visual style choices, and the music help to make this, arguably, the most immersive and atmospheric open-world game I have ever played, and it serves the gameplay perfectly.Gameplay:  This is the best and most top-notch Gameplay I have ever experienced, period.  The controls are so darn good that you could bounce a dime of them and get change leftover.  As a veteran Zelda player, there was a learning curve to the controls at first, but after getting accustomed to them, they really did feel like second nature.  This is the first 3D Zelda to have a jump button, a simple addition that changes the Gameplay mechanics significantly.  Furthermore, the ability to climb in this game also adds a whole new dimension to the Gameplay.This time around, the enemy AI is quite advanced for a Zelda title.  The enemies also do quite a bit more damage to Link than they ever have before in a 3D title.  What this means is that every encounter, and combat situation feels dangerous, and as though something is at stake.  Link’s arsenal of weapons this time around includes far more than just a single sword, but many swords, as well as sticks, axes, spears, clubs, magic rods, and more.  You also have a plethora of shields to use, and bows to use.  The weapons in this game do break after being used a bit, which might be a point of contention to some.  I love this mechanic, and feel that it forces you as the player to think and be strategic as to how you approach every encounter with an enemy.  Link can also use stealth to sneak up on his enemies, destroy exploding barrels nearby and watch the enemies scream in horror (such as satisfying feeling,) or even use his rune abilities to take the enemies out before they know what hit them (more on that later.)  The possibilities in this game feel almost endless.  The coolest move Link can pull off in this game is the flurry rush; when fighting an enemy close-up, if you dodge just in time, Link will do a dodge or backflip in slow-motion, and proceed by striking the enemy several times, ending them in the process.  It’s the coolest thing ever.In this game, Link uses a plethora of abilities known as the Rune abilities.  With these abilities, Link can create remote bombs that he can explode upon impact whenever desired.  You can also use Cryonis, which creates ice blocks from water, which can be used as platforms to climb.  You can use what is called stasis, which temporarily freezes objects in place, allowing you to hit them several times, after which point they go flying every which way.  Then there is Magnesis, which is my favorite.  This allows Link to push, pull, and lift heavy metal objects from afar, and use them to make paths, or even drop them on enemies from a distance.  You’ll often stumble upon scenarios, particularly in the dungeons and shrines, that allow you to find your own clever ways of solving puzzles with these brilliant and fun mechanics.  Like every aspect of the game, the experimentation alone will soak up hours of your life.Speaking of shrines and dungeons, the dungeons in this game are vastly different than in previous Zelda games.  Whereas previous Zelda’s had you collect keys, a key item, in order to make it to the final boss fight, this game’s dungeons are more based around experimentation and manipulation.  Through using Link’s powers and abilities, as well as the map in this game, it allows Link to manipulate the layout of the dungeon, and essentially bend them to his will.  This is another aspect of this Zelda that feels so fresh and fun.  The bosses at the end of the dungeon are also really fun to fight.  While the game only has four main dungeons, there are more than 100 mini shrines throughout.  The shrines are essentially bite-sized dungeons, and play-out as such on a micro level.  Many of them require you to use your rune abilities to solve them and progress, while others have you engage in a little boss fight of sorts with a guardian robot.  Needless to say, these shrines are fantastic and provide some of the most enjoyable and mind-bending scenarios I’ve ever encountered, and manage to surprise at every turn.  Moreover, the whole over-world almost feels like one giant, outdoor dungeon.  What I mean by that is that while it isn’t literally a huge dungeon, you begin solving puzzles and thinking about where, and how you want to proceed to the next shrine or dungeon right of the bat.  Simply getting to these shrines and dungeons feels like a puzzle in and of itself.Being a truly open-world game, this game’s real obstacle, beyond even the enemies and the dungeons, is the world itself.  This game is an open world adventure game, but it’s also a survival one.  This world feels alive.  The weather changes, the wild-life has a mind of its own, and the world will try to kill you in a multitude of ways.  Whether it be by falling from foolishly attempting to climb massive heights, to lightning striking your metal items, to the wild animals such as bears and wolves that see you as their next meal.  Furthermore, the realistic and ingenious physics engine makes the game world feel more natural.The trick then, is to use the world to your advantage.  By hunting wild animals and gathering supplies and ingredients, Link can cook a multitude of dishes and elixirs to refill both his heart meter (no hearts in pots or grass in this game) or his stamina gauge.  You can hunt just about any wild animal you see in the wild.  Cooked meat is always more effective than raw meat in straightening you, and you can combine it with other ingredients like fruits, vegetables, or grains and wheat to increase their effect.  You can make potions by combining critters such as lizards, frogs, or bugs with monster parts that provide different temporary stat boosts.  Just look out for the dubious food!  You can also break chunks of rocks to find minerals, ore, and other materials.  By buying and selling these goods, you create your own in game economy of sorts.The other aspect of this game that makes it truly feel like the “open air�?experience that Eji Aonuma called it is none other than the glorious climbing mechanic.  You can climb almost anything in this game, whether it be a rock face, a cliff, buildings, towers, Hyrule Castle itself, the Temple of Time, you name it.  You can even climb trees, and certain rock monsters that appear throughout the world.  Climbing is yet another big component and aspect to this game that Nintendo really got down pat, and it does feel like a game changer.  I’ve played several games where you can climb certain things, like Assassin’s Creed or Uncharted, but never has it been this freeing in how you can do it.  This simple yet elegant mechanic really makes the already huge world feel even bigger.  Climbing will slowly eat up your stamina gauge, so it’s up to you to figure out how you want to approach it, and finding little footholds is always a good way to rest when you need to.  The only places you can’t climb every wall is in the dungeons and the shrines.  The other open-air aspect to this world is the paraglider.  When you reach the top of the mountain or a tower, you don’t need to worry about climbing all the way back down.  Now, Link can simply jump off the cliff, and glide down to the world below ala Batman.  This mechanic remains euphoric from start to finish.  It is also an ingenious way to fix what could have been a potential problem before it happened, by allowing you to breezily get down a mountain pf tower right off the bat without having to climb all the way back down.In this game, you can catch any number of wild horses, tame them, and check them into a stable.  In past Zelda’s, your horse was Epona, and it was the only horse you could get.  Here, there are several horses, some are harder to get than others, and they all have different stats.  When you do catch your horse, it really does feel like your own horse, since you caught it, tamed it, and gave it a name.  You can hold up to five horses at any given time, and ride around the world, into the villages, and even approach combat while on horseback with your melee weapons and bows.  As someone who finds joy and excitement by simply exploring the game world, and doing random things, riding around Hyrule has never felt more fun.  I used to love doing that all the way back in Twilight Princess, and this aspect puts that game to shame.  The Horses can die, which may seem annoying to some, but I love it as, once again, it offers more strategy and thinking than previous games.  When fighting a Guardian, it’s better going up against it on horseback as you have the element of speed on your side.Unlike previous Zelda games, where boss battles were restricted to the dungeons themselves, here in Breath of the Wild, you will often encounter boss like enemies in the world.  These come in the form of giant rock monsters (Stone Talus,) Centaur-like creatures (Lynels, another throwback to Zelda on NES,) and the now iconic game enemy known as the Guardian’s (octopus-like robots that attempt to kill you throughout the game.)  You can approach these enemies however you choose, or not approach them at all and leave them be at first.  Throughout the game, as you become more powerful, you may be bold enough to take them on, it is all up to you.  The first time I killed a Guardian was a defining moment for me, as was my first Lynel kill.  What’s amazing is that even after you have several of the key upgrades, the enemies still feel like a threat.What makes the Gameplay in Breath of the Wild so good, and so perfect, is that you as the player can literally approach it however you want.  The whole world is your oyster, and it’s up to you to figure out how you want to use it.Replay value.  This game has lots of reason to play even after your first initial playthrough, which will likely take at least forty hours if you just do the main story.  I have played this game from start to finish a few times already (and probably will several more times.)  As it stands, you can find all of the optional things in the game (the Master Sword itself is optional,) Find and beat all of the shrines, collect all of the Korok seeds (plant like creature fans may know from Wind Waker,) and do any number of side-quests.  The side-quests I have done have all been tremendously fun, and while the rewards may be simple, just playing them feels like a reward.  You can help herd cucoos for a chicken-freak in Kakariko village, catch a royal white-steed, help a man start a village from the ground-up, and even build your own house in Hateno Village.  This game has tons of replay value, apart from just the urge to go back and play it again.  Because of the open-ended nonlinear nature of this game, you can replay the game from start to finish, and take a completely different path, even so far as taking on the last boss right away (though not a good idea if you value your life.)  Just experimenting with all the different weapons, finding all the different locations and using your rune abilities will keep you distracted for quite some time.**Nintendo Switch differences:Having played this game on the Switch as well as the Wii U, I can safely say that either version will deliver an incredible experience.  That said, the Switch version is probably ever so slightly the superior version.  Apart from running a little bit better, I found the switch controller very comfortable, particularly with how easy it is the detach the joy-cons from the controller slots to the tablet-screen.  Speaking of which, playing this game on the go is a lot of fun.  I would recommend saving the key story moments for the TV, but playing the game casually undocked with the Switch screen has felt great. **Verdict:The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a Masterpiece, and a game I feel will be looked at as a timeless classic.  While it isn’t literally “perfect,�?it has its occasional frame-rate issues, and the very occasional camera issue, it is, to me, as close to flawless as video game’s get.  I haven’t been this immersed, this addicted, or simply had this much fun with a single player game in years, if not decades.  This is the best game Nintendo has made in likely the past twenty years, if not ever.  I have no regrets in saying I am ready to move on from Ocarina of Time being my all-time favorite video game, as Breath of the Wild now takes the cake.  This is the game that really feels tailored to be played however you choose.  It feels like the fully realized Zelda game that Nintendo has always wanted to make, and the one we as fans have been salivating for.  A new Zelda of any kind is always a big deal, but this one feels uniquely special.  I hyped this game to Death Mountain and back, and not only does it meet expectations, it defies them.  This feels like a giant playground full of joy, wonder, discovery exploration, and fun.  This is a game of survival, action, adventure, comedy, sadness, joy, and excitement, all wrapped into one package.  To say it bluntly, this has everything that makes Gaming such a great past-time to me, and millions of people, and it manages to capture the essence of Zelda most of all.  This is an absolute must-buy, and a must play.  I would honestly encourage you to get a Wii U, or a Nintendo Switch if you do not already have one, to experience this Masterpiece.  So get it, play it, enjoy it, and take a Breath of the magnificent Wild.Cons:Occasional frame-rate issuesPros:Sublime ControlsPerfect, Flawless, and incredible GameplayMasterful Open-World ExplorationFreedom and personal choiceMechanics encourage experimentationFresh new dungeon designAmazing art directionBrilliant music and sound designGreat Voice ActingGreat Story and awesome charactersLots of secrets to findLots of replay valueOverall: 10/10Peace, Dana",

    "review Text": "In general, one of the most amazing games I've ever played. This game has set the bar for action-RPG combat mechanics. I'm so tired of games that rely on dice-rolling or lazy hardcoded animations in combat (MMORPGs, I'm looking at you), leaving it feeling unconvincing. Zelda's heavy use of physics and clever animation made the stick/axe/sword/whatever register with the enemies perfectly. You feel every single hit, and it's so damn satisfying.If I listed everything great about this game, they would far outnumber my cons below.If Nintendo decides to make another massive Zelda title like this again, I do have some hopes and wishes for it, where I felt like this one fell a little short in some ways, despite being so good anyway:�?As a Zelda game, it felt like quite a few things were missing, but I also get that they're trying to break conventions a bit.�?There could have been more variety in enemies. There was heavy reuse of the base enemy types for each biome, but I would have liked to see more unique enemies for each area, as in the temples and areas in past Zelda titles.�?Overall, the world felt pretty empty, despite having stables and a few small towns.�?Breaking weapons kept things constantly fresh, but having more permanent weapons as a major reward for completing the Divine Beast temples or shrines would have been really nice for progression. Much like the Master Sword gives a bonus for certain enemy types, more weapons like this could have existed to give bonuses in certain regions or climates. This idea could pair really well with more unique enemies and having to find the optimal approach to defeating them.�?While the boomerangs were amazing and challenging to use, they were way too easy to lose if they weren't breaking too. I always hesitated to use them because there was such a high chance of it hitting a ledge and falling down a cliff to be lost forever.�?Overall, while this game had an alright story, the wonder and mystery of walking into places like The Forest, Shadow, and Spirit temples from Ocarina of Time was totally missing for me in this game. Zelda has always been a game where its outlandish environments and temples really set the tone for where you were at in the game. Breath of the Wild remained pretty neutral feeling for most of the game.�?I was really disappointed when I found that Korok Forest was a small little area after passing The Lost Woods. I wish they had considered making it and the surrounding area explorable. The whole idea of the Lost Woods is getting lost, yes, but as a lover of forests in RPG games, I really wanted it to be as big as it looked on the map.",

This game turned the series on its head and reinvented the whole formula and I couldn't be happier! This game is perfection. I went into it with relatively modest expectations as I just didn't know how well Zelda would mesh with a true open world \"do anything, anywhere\" kind of formula. Yes they've tried that with the original Zelda but it's never been done on this scale. I tend to get overwhelmed by open world games just because of the massive scale but I never once felt the world was too big. If anything I was excited to keep exploring and see EVERYTHING the game had to offer. There are a LOT of things to explore and collect in this game. Being that the game is just a massive shift in the Zelda formula, it does ditch a few key things like traditional dungeon design and accumulating items, while adding in things like cooking for survival. But as the game is I wouldn't change a thing. It could be the most perfect game Nintendo has ever released.",

Normally when you see a mountain in the distance, it's just a picture.  Here, you can walk to it.  At any point in the game.-Runes and climbing provide ample means of exploring and manipulating the environment.  I'd say there's plenty of opportunity to sequence-break, but there's not really much of a \"sequence\" to start with.  The game is yours.-Compendium:  Adds an element of collectathon to the game.  Something for completionists to strive for while being useful to they leyperson (can be used to track items/monsters or let you know if you've seen it before)-Amiibo usage:  you can get unique items in-game (such as the Fierce Deity Armor).  For those without Amiibo, worry not, these don't count at all towards 100% as none of them appear in the Compendium-Durability helps keep the gameplay from stagnating.  You have the best weapon in the game?  Not for long!  Particularly with the weapons you find laying around, it also makes a lot of sense.  I wouldn't expect a 100-year old, rusted sword to fare well in a fight with a Lynel-Master Mode provides ample challenge for those who seek it.  Don't believe me?  Go fight a Lynel with a stick on the Great Plateau (fortunately this mode is optional)CONS:-Durability can sometimes get old.

I completed 112 shrines, collected over 200 korok seeds and completed many quests. I decided to start a new game and it still feels like a new experience. I find myself going straight to my favorite parts of the game and it is still amazing that there is no mandatory order or path to keep going.I feel like over the years everyone has been spoiled with better graphics and gameplay. The most complaints I heard about the game was frame rate/lag issues, especially around multiple monsters or non-playable characters. But that means nothing to me. I experienced it a few times but it did not drop the game rating from 5 stars.I love the scenery. No matter where you are there is always something beautiful to look at. The landscapes are gorgeous and I love the way everything shines when it rains. Catching wild horses is also fun. I swear I have caught over 40 or 50 horses.It doesn't matter what you get into in the game. There are always tricks to getting more of what you want. Take a picture of whatever you want to find, vegetables, stones, ingredients, tools, weapons, anything really, and your Sheika slate (tablet that Link uses in the game) will help guide you to find more. I'm always looking for precious metals/stones and it is the easiest way to get 10 thousand rupees or more. However much you need or want.There are so many quests and challenges. Puzzles that require you to find different characters to get hints or answers. Or to help you find a location of something. Everyone has their own likes and opinions, but to me, Breath of the Wild has no frustrating tasks or quests. I have enjoyed every bit of the game. I loved, loved, loved Breath of the Wild.The first Zelda game I played was on the Gameboy, Oracle of Seasons. I thought it was fun and great. Especially for its time and portability. I did not consider myself a big Zelda fan until Twilight Princess, though. I own the Wii version and the HD version for the Wii U. I think it will always be my favorite. It is hard to beat a game that allows you to turn into a wolf! I was very excited when I found out that you could bring wolf Link into Breath of the Wild and even use Epona. I use both of them all the time. I'm also very excited about the upcoming DLCs and new story to come. UPDATE: They are here! Very good so far! Good back stories.Recently, I have started playing Ocarina of Time on my 3DS. It is hard to get used to the controls, the smaller screen, and lower graphics but I have heard from so many of my friends that it is one of the best Zelda games ever made. It is hard to compare Breath of the Wild to Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword because you do not have all of the freedom to roam around wherever you want. Breath of the Wild IS freedom. Skyward Sword did give you the option to fly anywhere above the clouds and the worlds were very big but it still does not come close to Breath of the Wild. I haven't played Wind Waker, Majora's Mask or other remakes and older entries of the series but I will eventually.",

With that said, I can tell you the difference in resolution is barely noticeable, and in just a few cases only, and even then, it doesn't affect the visual; in fact, the Switch's version visuals are a big upgrade from Wii U's.  There are more details, more colors, and there are more little details like more grass and flowers around.  Not necessarily a good thing all the time, as they can sometimes hide goodies... but in a way, it makes finding stuff more satisfying.  Also, there are slight, but welcome addition to detail on shadows and reflections.  That aside, I played the game first without the updates installed.  Not much difference in terms of framerate and smoothness from the Wii U version.  AFTER updating, however, the significant increase in smoothness of framerate and overall animations in the game has made me go \"WOW\" all over again.  Loading times aren't that different, however, but Switch is still faster by seconds.  Overall, I believe this wonderfully huge game, where you are free to roam the vast land of Hyrule to find treasure, upgrades, tools, food, and fight baddies, while following a slow, but interesting story that is barely there to interrupt your exploration, is worth buying and playing from one corner to the next, and back, and I do plan on getting the DLC contend for this very soon.",

This game reminds me of a combination of different games (Skyrim, Jak and Daxter, and others), all of which are among my favorites. I absolutely love open world games, it gives you the freedom to explore wherever you like, which is half the fun of this game! The combat is pretty different than most games, weapons break fairly often which can be irritating, but there are some that have incredibly strong durability. I play this game whenever I can; in the mornings before work, when I get home from work, and all throughout the weekend. And I love that I can go from the TV to the handheld in seconds!

It's vast, detailed (to me, anyhow- I never played Witcher or Skyrim or anything like that for over a couple minutes) and looks great. I've seen no slowdown in handheld or console mode, and have gotten all the play time I've needed (so, apparently less than 2 or 3 hours at a session) between dockings.I love having so much exploration and experimentation to do, and to be able to just take it with me wherever, sneak in what play time I may, and then put it to sleep or resume in a second. But that's more the Switch in general than this game particularly.The game is a good fit to the console, I think. And it's easily the best-looking handheld title I've ever played, without feeling like a handheld game.It takes a little bit to learn, but you do acquire basically all the skills you need to solve every puzzle in the game after the first 4 shrines- the rest is a question of searching, surviving, and creative solutions.Everywhere in this game there's SOMEthing to do or see, large or small, and frequently more than one thing. I expect to be playing and enjoying this for a very long time, based on my time so far.You're probably tired of hearing it's a must-buy, yes? It's magic, it cured my bald spot, it makes you delicious breakfast, walks the dog, reads your mind, and so on.Well, yes. It's great. There's a part at the start where you may need to get used to the controls and mechanics, but they're mostly explained- thank goodness the old man at the start says more than just \"It's dangerous to go alone, take this.\" But you'd swear he's a relative of that guy.Anyhow... if you have a Switch and don't have this game, it's a worthy purchase. The game card version is 1-2 seconds slower to load areas than internal memory or microSD, I've heard, but it hasn't been a problem for me.If you like exploring, Zelda, and small-ish physics and skill-based puzzles (in the form of shrines), give it a try. You may find yourself addicted.Tips: Don't get too attached to your weapons. Even the best ones, you'll find something just as good in a day or so most likely. Cooking is done by choosing materials from inventory, selecting Hold and then dumping them in a cookpot if you find one- that's one thing that isn't explained by the old man, and it WILL be useful to know for many reasons. And listen to what that old guy at the start says- he gives good advice. Lastly, and this is what makes the game enjoyable for me: if you see something cool in the distance, go there. Detours from the main quest can very easily lead you somewhere just as fun, and if you don't like an area for some reason, you can just head for the horizon and explore elsewhere, coming back when you're feeling up to it, or even not coming back at all.",

These are the type of people who need 1ms response to make even minesweeper enjoyable.This game looks absolutely amazing on the switch itself and still vibrant and pretty while docked. Mechanics are intuitive, but may require some prior research. Shrines are short, but with the addition of motion control based puzzles (oh god), I'm happy that they aren't too long.I normally hate open world games because of how repetitive they get and how quickly they morph into walking simulators (even FFXV with all the quick travel took forever), but zelda is large enough to feel vast, but the gliding and teleportation makes getting places much easier.",

    "review Text": "This is not only a fantastic game in its own right, it's also a great evolution of the Zelda series. And having it available on a portable console like the Switch is amazing. The game world is gigantic, but has also been finely tuned so there are always new things to discover in almost every area as you gain new abilities. The lack of hand-holding makes you feel like you're discovering new things all the time as you experiment and explore. And it's great that there are often multiple ways to approach a particular puzzle or situation. The fact that your weapons break so often has been given as a negative by many people, but I find that it forces you to use your weapons more strategically, saving your best ones for the really hard enemies, and it also ensures that you'll actually use many of the \"lesser\" weapons in the game instead of just sticking with one best option.However, I find the game's story to be underwhelming. Part of this is due to the extreme freedom that you are given. You uncover many important parts of the story via flashbacks hidden around the map, and it's very possible (likely, even) that people will finish the game without having found all of these. This gives the story a fragmented feeling, and in general it just doesn't seem very engaging to me compared to most other games. I also found the voice acting to be surprisingly sub-par -- not bad, really, but not good either. Many of the English voice actors seem to have been miscast, and the game's writing style also doesn't really work that well with voice acting, giving many of the lines a stilted, awkward feeling. There's also very little actual voice work in the game -- to the point where I feel they might have been better off without voice acting at all.The game's exceptional sandbox world and game mechanics largely make up for these minor flaws, but I do feel like they keep the game from being a 10/10 (if this were a 10-point scale, I would give it a 9). But regardless, I would recommend this game highly to just about anyone.",

I've played every Zelda game so far, and while I haven't finished this one yet, know it won't be my favorite. If this was in percentages, I'd give it 85%.It's INCREDIBLY different from all previous games in the series, and that isn't a bad thing. It's good that they took risks instead of making the same game again. Rather than collecting hearts or cutting down bushes to find arrows, you have to cook your own food and purchase arrows. The cooking was originally off putting but I found it fun after a short amount of time. The enemies come back stronger, there's different ways to fight, and there's many weapons to choose from which allows for a more personalized play style. Overall it's quite a bit of fun. If I sit down to play for an hour I'll typically play for 2-4, so that in itself says it's rather compelling...when I actually start playing it.Without giving away anything, you spend a large portion of the game searching for memories and can go in any order. It's fun for awhile, but so easy to get distracted that I never really feel compelled to play again. I can say \"I'm going to Death Mountain\" and then get distracted for 15 hours. So yes, there's tons to do, but I prefer a game that I'm excited to play because I know something interesting is going to happen instead of climbing cliffs for 5 hours. Which in itself is fun, but it takes away from the plot by leaving large amounts of time in between events. Weapons breaking is REALLY annoying. And don't get me started on the rain. Think you're gonna climb a cliff? No, it's going to start raining when you're halfway up and then you have to pick your nose and check your cell phone for 7 minutes while you wait for the rain to end. And the shrines are fun...until you get bored with them. And then there's more.So it is a great game, but overall not as compelling as many of the others. I love the concept and the plot as well as much of the combat and the cooking, but it takes so long to connect the dots and is so easy to get distracted that I don't find it as enjoyable as some of the other games. I find myself much less emotionally involved.",

After a few games of the same Zelda format Breath of the Wild really stands out on it's own. Once again it reinvents the Zelda franchise. It's not your typical Zelda game. It's entirely open world and most of the story can go untouched if you don't seek it out. I would say this is a exploration game. It's not linear at all. It's entirely exploration. This world is huge and you'll be doing hours of exploration. The story is rather simple but very interesting since the story tells of how Link lost and this is his redemption. It resembles the first Zelda game where as it's open world, limited story, non linear and many things that you can miss out on. But if you enjoy the Zelda universe I definitely say this is a must play. You could beat the game in any length you want. Play it for 10 hours or 200 hours. The choice is up to you. Fight Ganon right away or explore and build your skills then fight him. Be the legend.And for those whom are giving it a score of 1. No words can explain what's going through your mind.

This game encourages you to spend hours climbing and doing nothing productive to the story... and it's still so entertaining. No you're not required to climb that huge cliff in the distance. But... why not?The story and gameplay is still Zelda but the openness of it has you going places you shouldn't be and feeling proud of still accomplishing something in that area. I find myself seeking out towers I shouldn't be near yet. My most victorious moment so far was activating a tower in Hyrule field surrounded by Guardians that will one shot kill you and somehow surviving with a new price of the map - with only 4 hearts.The story is pretty awesome and I can't help but rave at the comparison between you as the player knowing nothing of what's happening and the amesiac Link also knowing nothing. The comparison is even more apparent when searching for memories. As the player you are doing what Link would do.My only \"complaint\" is that weapons go bad QUICK. I'm constantly searching for more swords, bows, etc. But that's just another excuse for me to climb more mountains to search so not big for me.Just wow Nintendo, wow.

BOtW is by far the best Zelda game I've played to date, as much as I love BOtW and its gameplay I still missed the motion control and the puzzles that uses it in Skyward, if I had to say although there are tons of puzzle shrines in BoTW they are still the same with minor variation and I think they're to me personally is why prefer skyward sword. I love the open world apporch in BoTW but also love the gameplay in Skyward.BotW is an Awesome entry to the series that does a good job breaking away from the traditional Zelda but in a good way, but I wouldn't say the first time Zelda players should be discourage from playing the past games because they're great on their own.",

The AI is incredibly interesting, they might seem dumb at first but they are so well programmed it will shock you through the whole game. The weapons break and this keeps you searching for new weapons all the time, and also encourages you to be resourceful. Bause of this you use weapons you might other pass up. Boomerangs in this game are amazingly fun. Shield surfing should be in every Zelda from now on. It is the best way to get around in an open world game, ever.There are small frame rate drops in TV mode (not in handheld mode) in areas of thick grass and forest. There arent as many dungeons as I would have hoped, but the 120 shrines make up for this. The bosses dont feel distinct or unique, which has always been a key feature of other zelda games. Rain in this game makes it impossible to do anything almost, and because the rain is so frequent it becomes very inconvenient.These are my only \"cons\" that stand out to me.

Yes -- it might sound hokey, but, in all earnestness, I haven't felt so many 'wow' moments in a single-player game since I was a kid playing Super Mario 64 and Ocarina of Time -- when 3D console games still had the 'new' factor to lend to our enjoyment.After the PS2/GameCube era, I have felt like single-player games have lost a lot of their charm. And it's not just because the 'new' factor wore off, but because so many titles have fallen into big-budget developer pitfalls -- things like dark/violent settings (which often feel a little forced); incessant tutorial sequences; grinding mechanics that make progression feel like a chore; poorly written scripted sequences and cutscenes; etc.Occasionally these types of games produce something greater than the sum of their parts (like The Last of Us), but, largely, that classic feeling seemed to be fading away behind the rising wall of sameness.I say 'seemed' because, for me, Breath of the Wild changes all of that.I've never played a game that felt so tailor-made for my enjoyment -- as it combines elements from its own illustrious series with the atmospheric wonder of Shadow of the Colossus or Ico, the explorative 'what will I see next?' charm of older Final Fantasy games, a unique art style like Okami, Dark Cloud 2, or Beyond Good and Evil, a giant map full of breath-taking scenery like The Elder Scrolls and Red Dead Redemption, along with liberating traversal -- like if Lara Croft could climb ANY wall, or if Sora from Kingdom Hearts got the cool gliding ability at the beggining of the game instead of the near-end.Breath of the Wild takes all of this and manages to distill it into a cohesive, and long-lasting experience that is actually fun (an important word!) to play -- regardless of whether you are an existing The Legend of Zelda fan or a total newcomer.PLAY THIS GAME.",

It runs beautiful on my tv (midsize, LG) and the music is lovely.The only complaint I have about this game so far is the text.

But if your best weapons can break than how can you feel a sense of progression?Other issues don't seem to get as much attention. An example is lighting lanterns with blue fire. This requires setting the blue flame on to a torch or arrow. Problem is, some areas will start to rain. So I light a few lanterns then the rain makes it impossible to keep going. I leave, sleep, go back, and start again. But the rain returns! Also, in rain, you often get struck by lightning!Some will argue that the lightning is an aspect of realism. As far as I know, being outside in a storm doesn't mean you become a magnet for lighting regardless of your elevation. Yes, someone can get hit, but to always get hit is ridiculous and irritating.My point in mentioning these things is Breath Of The Wild is not a perfect game. But there is enough good aspects to make up for a lot of the bad. After probably playing for sixty hours and beaten Ganon, I still have more armors to get, more shrines to do, more sidequests, etc. Giving me a reason to go back when I feel like collecting, doing puzzles, or seeing more of the wonderfully detailed world. Maybe the best sidequest involves helping a builder start a town. I won't give it all away but moments like that make this game something you'll remember for a long time.

    "review Text": "**No spoiler review**At this point, I could never have imagined the game industry without this game.  Every once in a while, a game comes out that just says what everyone is thinking subconsciously but cannot quite make out the words, an itch that needs to be scratched, that puts all the pieces together in entertainment culture and builds the foundation for the next age for the game industry.  This is that game.Gameplay: The limits have been lifted.  There are almost no restrictions to the possibilities of engagement with the environmental situations.  Remember how amazing the Metroid screw jump felt in Metroid Prime 2, flying for the first time in Mario 64, jumping through the web in the Deku tree in Ocarina of Time, etc.  In those moments, you knew you had experienced something that would change you, that you were playing a game that reached far beyond what you thought was possible.  Now imagine a game that applies that feeling to every element of the game.  While diverging some from past Zelda mechanics, they are changes that encourage you to grow as a player and engage in your environment and as such could not have been any other way.  Don't worry, it is very nicely balanced.Music: Even the music approach has been redefined for this game.  Eerie, peaceful, and epic.  I do not think a single note in this game is synthesized and the sensation feels like the game is calling to you or empathizing with you.  The music element is used in a way that is unlike anything you probably have experienced before, hearkening back to the complex music development in intellectual music of the 20th century.  The best visual reference I can give is that the music feels like water hitting your skin, that is how tangible it is.Graphics: When a design is this polished and revolutionary, graphics, while normally being the easiest to pinpoint, easily take more of a backseat, however this game has some of the most psychologically stimulating environments of any game in recent years.  Graphics for this game cannot be discussed separate from gameplay as everything flows together in a near perfect fashion.  The physics used in conjunctions with the models and layout of the map are immediately accessible and complex.  Here are some examples of scope: The scope of the land is so vast and varied that every minute exploring provides an almost entirely different experience than the one just prior. A friend of mine is playing the game and while we have both been exploring the same areas, neither of us over the course of three days came across the exact same elements in the exact same way other than a town that the story led us both to.  *In the overview of the world as seen in the picture on the box cover, every viewable (and not viewable) crevice is an entirely different world of exploration that is both gorgeous and fully interactive.Design: Arguably the best quality of Breath of the Wild is how the elements come together.  The expanse and themes, while Zelda, feel like they were taken out of the imagination of the renaissance 80s, a characteristic usually only touched on by unique cult-classic romps but here is fully realized in an immersive experience.  The characters have such a unique and retro feel that they are both unsettling and comforting in the same breath. From the music to the landscape to the vocals and setting, this game truly brings together all the design elements in a masterful way.CONS: (nit-picking; do not read this section) Amidst all of these amazing elements, there are a few potential improvements that could be made.1) There are not voice-overs for all NPC dialog.  This was a similar complaint that I had with the last 2 home console Zelda titles.  If the production values on the game are high enough to immerse you as this title has done, all NPC lines should be voiced rather than only a few.2) The obvious cloud shadows during high sun are so realistic that it makes you look up, however the clouds in the sky do not coincide with the shadows. Often I would expect to see a close cloud or a storm front coming in, and not have either.3) Some powers suffer from quirky control mapping.4) Simple textures and meshes often are crude for the sake of object and environment scope.  Forgiveable, but noticeable.5) The interactive detail in the game is so high that it is noticeable when Link's hands don't lineup with climbing elements or when objects quickly \"transition\" into items *cough* tree trunks *cough*6) Greatly miss the presence of at least a few major in-ground elements or dungeons.  Most of the world is the same \"trial\" format with huge surface landscapes.7) More purpose, depth, and variety in the lives of the NPC characters that inhabit Hyrule. (As far as engine planning, this element could require as much preparation as the development of the world itself.)8) Inability to change the view if needed. (When in a tree, avoiding being seen or fire from horseback bokoblins, the leaves and branches become too much of a visual obstruction from accurately shooting arrows or observing.*All of these will likely improve or appear in future Zelda games overtime.  Again, this game is the dawn of a new age and standard in game design.I have not been as satisfied and amazed with a game as I am with Breath of the Wild since Nintendo 64.  This game has the same feeling as the first arrival of Ocarina of Time, Mario 64, Link to the Past, Final Fantasy 7, Super Mario Brothers, and Super Mario World.  Up until now, nothing had dethroned Majora's Mask, Metroid Prime, and Ocarina of Time as my best, new favorite experiences, despite having played the large expanse and epic battles of Shadows of the Colossus, the emotional play of Resident Evil 4, the new learning approach and vicarious interactions of The Last Guardian, and nearly every other major release from Bethesda, Naughty Dog, and more. This game has surpassed all of my prior memories and claimed its rightful place as the game that defines gaming. I never thought I would feel that level of amazement again in the industry, but it is here and it isn't even VR.  Game design at it's finest and why Nintendo still remains the definitive development standard.",

I, having played and owning every Zelda game to date, find Breath of the Wild to be my new favorite for adventure.Those of you who enjoy the structure of dungeon after dungeon will be disappointed as Breath of the Wild does not follow this pattern and can be accomplished in any order or even without completing some portions.

Breath of the Wild just may outdo them all, or at the very least, it has earned an honored place beside them.This is the very definition of a killer app:  an application *so great* that it is worth buying the entire platform.  Even if there is never another great game on Switch ever again (and there definitely will be with Mario Odyssey), it was entirely worth it.  I say this even though we already had a Wii U so I wasn't forced to upgrade.The world of BotW is enormous, beautiful, and the right amount of dangerous.  Even if I'm not pursuing a specific quest, it's exhilarating just to head off into new terrain and explore.  Scale a tricky mountain -- then paraglide off it into parts unknown -- then land in a field of wild horses -- then capture and befriend one -- then dart off across the landscape at high speed past enormous monsters into further adventures.  Wow.  And of course, there are tons of main quests, side quests, and shrines to explore, each of which gives you a tiny advantage that makes things a bit easier and a bit more fun going forward.  For example, you might gain just a little more hit points (hearts), or a little more stamina (to help run further or climb higher obstacles), or you might run across a piece of gear that lets you swim up waterfalls (so cool).  And then there was the time when I was suddenly surrounded by monsters riding bears, and I was tempted to warp out to safety, when I managed to knock one off his mount -- and realized I could jump on the bear myself and tame him.  I rode him around a bit but they wouldn't accept him at the stables.  :^)Tons more I could say, but the last thing I'll say for now is that this is a great game to play either alone or with friends or grade-school-age kids.  We tend to play all together, and sometimes, one of the kids will sneak the Switch to their rooms to play by themselves.  (One likes to cook and tame wild horses, the other likes to roam and smash monsters.  I like to find all the secrets and beat all the puzzles.)  We're well over 200 hours at this point, and could have easily beat the final battle long ago, and still loving it.  (Just 1 shrine left!)",

While many have considered the 3D Zelda series as becoming stagnant and repetitive, this seemed to be an overall reimagining of the franchise.Taking a page from open world RPGs like Skyrim and Fallout, Breath of the Wild is less about saving the princess in the castle and more about exploring and discovering a vast world. And what a world it is! With a visual style and music that is reminiscent of Miyazaki, the world of Breath of the Wild is vast and breathtaking,  giving the player a sense of discovery rarely found in games. Direction is not restrictive in Breath of the Wild. As Link, you can climb mountains, swim in the ocean and even quickly fight the main villain if you so choose.However, no game is without its flaws, and Breath of the Wild has its issues. For one, the directon-less nature of the game can be a flaw, especially if you end up in an area that is much harder than what you're currently capable of handling. Additionally, the weapon system is perhaps one of the worst I've ever experienced. Weapons, even the ones found late-game, break way too easily, causing one to hoard weapons for fear of breaking them when you need them most. Lastly, Shrines. While novel at first, Shrines in Botw eventually become tedious and repetitive. To the point where after seeing a shrine, I chose to skip it and maybe come back to it later. The issue with shrines even affected the Champion's Ballad DLC, where the game seemed to say \"Hope you like shrines, cause here's a whole lot more.\"On the note of BOTW DLCs, I would say don't expect much. Master Trials, while fun, ultimately doesn't add much to the game. And while Champion's Ballad does add some back story and a new boss, it doesn't do anything interesting like add new enemies or expand upon the world.Despite its flaws I would say it's still worth it.",

It requires more effort to progress in the game and find everything, but it is so rewarding to spend the time looking for melee weapons, food, bows, shields, and a host of other materials. The fact that weapons can wear out and break adds a little more realism, which bothered me at first, but later I saw it as an opportunity to swap out for new or different weapons.

Unlike any other games that I have played that mostly sell themselves on exploring an open world, locations and regions in Zelda feel alive, interesting, and carefully designed.  The game does an excellent job of rewarding exploration and making the world field infinitely interactive. This game has an odd difficulty curve and the non-linear story due to the way the game was made so that you can do anything in any order you choose, but to me these are not negatives. Everything about this game gives you a sense of first danger, then wonder, then  a success as you grow more  a powerful. The leveling system feels very natural, and I personally like the way that weapon durability encourages you to strategize and switch up your weapons frequently. Great NPC interactions, enemies, and hundreds and hundreds of both open-world and closed puzzles to discover and solve. The sandbox nature means you can play forever if you wanted, but after over 100 hours of play I may be bringing my time with Breath of the Wild to a close. However, it has been an immensely memorable and enjoyable time discovering the world of Hyrule.",

I decided to give it a try, and after a few days of learning the controls and figuring out the gameplay, I've become totally obsessed with this game. I played for four hours last night and had to drag myself away when it was time to go to bed.The graphics are phenomenal, the storyline is interesting, and there's so much more to do than I could have imagined.

The voice acting is kind of awkward but nothing new to english dubs unfortunately.  The weapons are well varied with different fighting styles for each weapon type. The weapon durability is a bit of an issue in the beginning but as you progress you'll end up throwing out more stuff than you break. The music is a bit underwhelming for a zelda game but it's still good and you can listen to it for long periods of time without getting annoyed (no instrument to play in this game though.)

So I got it.  And it is really good.  The animation is pretty amazing.  The first month, of discovering different areas, was pretty fun. Discovering the world of Zelda is like exploring Disneyland.  There are different areas, and each area has it's own special character, landscape and weather.  There are three levels of quests.  The main quests like destroying Ganon, or freeing the Divine Beasts.  Then shrine quests, and less significant quests.  And then after awhile you figure out what sort of things to look for to find Korok seeds.  The variety of challenges and puzzles is very creative.",

    "review Text": "Breath of the Wild places you in an unfamiliar world and challenges you to explore it. It slowly and cleverly teaches you how to interact with its world while allowing the player to discover (and fail) on their own.My favorite part of Zelda games has always been exploring for the overworld for heart pieces/items and using dungeons to break those up. This game is almost entirely exploration and it's so fun to climb mountains, attack enemy camps, and search for shrines. I honestly find dungeons kind of frustrating in Zelda, as I usually end up getting stuck because I forgot to look behind one spot or missed a key somewhere. The shrines are perfect for me, a quick 5-10 minute puzzle that I can run through before moving on to the next thing.They also nailed the major issue I have with 3D Zeldas, namely that it takes too long to get anywhere. Fast travel opens up almost immediately after the game starts. What's better is there are tons of stuff to discover on the way to new areas. People on the roads, enemy camps, shrines, new plants, and animals etc.Finally, I have to comment on the people scattered throughout Hyrule. They're an utterly charming bunch of characters. My favorite was a man who offered to give me a tour of Hateno Village. His brimming enthusiasm about his town even though he was out of breath running from place to place put a big smile on my face.Even after putting dozens of hours into the game I can't wait to go home and play it some more. I haven't felt this way since Super Mario Galaxy and I've never had this feeling sustained for 60+ hours of gameplay. Nintendo pulled off an incredible feat, making a Zelda in the style of open world classics while outdoing other games in the genre in almost every way.",

    "review Text": "I went into this thinking I would be on the fence of a return/resale because I hate open world games almost completely.  Truth be told as I know lots of people are going to go crazy into write-ups I'll do this differently.  I will say I was done with Zelda, it was so over done, played out, boring to a fault with so little changed in 30 years only made more glaring and worse in 3D wide open empty spaces like in Twilight Princess that I never finished or came close to.  This game was a game changer for me.While this game is open world, all those issues people tend to have not liking such types of games, Nintendo took a hammer to the wall and broke that.  This game doesn't have that same dragged out truly overwhelming to an annoyance level size to it.  Yet it does have that size.  It's truly open to how you wish to play to the point, even when you clear the end game boss (did this last night) there's still more than 1/2 the game or more you can easily trek around on to do.  There's so much to see, learn, discover, and create (foods), upgrade (great fairies) and more you can kind of choose your own adventure any time you wish to fire it up.  A player could in theory drop this game in an hour if you just ignored the divine beasts and ran the back door for Ganon if you have some perfect timing on shield blocks, but realistically this one is one of those 50-100+(into the 100s easy) type hour game if you wish it.  You set your own size, time, and involvement.For me I did 14 hearts and 2 stamina boosts, got the master sword and went the back door into the castle and got the hylian shield as well.  In those 14 hearts 4 came from the divine beasts.  I played this game without a stop a bare minimum of 2 hours every day since it came out on the 3rd, some days I got as high at 6 probably averaging 4 a day really with it.  In that time I know I only hit around 1/3 of the shrines possible, did no side shrine quests basically, found one spring(there are 3 based upon the triforce parts) but didn't do the task, found/did 1 of the optional labyrinths, activated all the towers.To Nintendo: If/when you make a sequel on the Switch as you now have a years in development engine to use now I request you stick with this formula.  I was so spent on the old huge annoying dungeon and wide open empty spaces of 3D Zelda before this (Wind Waker aside) I was finished.  Making the quest itself from the 'area' to get the key item to fight the divine beast, then to do the puzzle beast interior and the ultimate boss on each that was a fantastic new approach to dungeon design I want to see continued.  This game is such a refreshing improvement on the franchise it has won me back over again.  Please do not go back to the old style, or even partly so like LBTW(3DS) as I couldn't stand that one either.  This works, it works so well I can happily return and keep investigating new areas or I can go back in and beat down Ganon at will once more when I get the last few memories.",

The fighting mechanic is pretty good as well. You can just run in and mash buttons but the enemies are tough and smart so dying is likely with that method which encourages thinking before acting or honing your fighting skills to effectively dodge or counter an enemies attack.There is voice acting in this game for the first time ever. It wasn't bad but I think it really could have been better. At times I felt it was really disjointed and I hope if Nintendo does voice acting again that it will be executed better.All in all I have put almost 200 hours into this game. It is completely worth it. I had so much fun, there's a ton to do. Those are really the only complaints I have. It is a very great game I have played a ton and have watched a ton of people play.

I chose a particularly interesting looking mountain that looked ridiculously large. The mountain was so far away and it took so long to get there.

I really enjoy challenging the new world and everything it's capable of.If you are complaining about this game:Just like when it comes to the core elements, \"Every book's already been writen\".

There are upgrades, exploration, labyrinths, puzzles, climate changes, weapons, armour. hidden stories and side quest galore.Besides my 11/10 score the game has one annoyance; rain climbing. Rain makes you unable to climb, which tends to take the flow of exploration away. The rain mechanic is great for everything else, including a plot related reason, how it changes the flora of the world and how lighting works. If I could mod the game I'd make climbing in the rain possible and use more stamina, but only after a related rain quest was complete. Water and climbing gear would negate the rain climbing penalty or be what makes it possible.Despite it's one annoyance BotW is a game everyone should play :)",

It has so much to offer that it feels like I been playing DLC without the DLC (and that's something even more to look forward to). After clocking over 60 hours I'm till finding all sorts of new locations and things to do. Best of all, almost everything in the game is optional, you'll get stronger and find better equipment the more time you clock in, however the game does let you dive into the void as early as you want and face your death.A great game for both new and old Zelda fans.",

It's as engaging for me as it is for my girlfriend who is not nearly as well-versed in games as I am, and for her two kids, ages 6 and 10. It's a family obsession right now and to me, that's well worth the cost of Switch (especially once Mario Kart 8 and Mario Odyssey are out)!The way the game's systems interact in the world means everybody plays a little differently, and it's been incredible to see how we all approach it differently. It's incredibly striking, visually, and the gameplay is as deep and fun as you want it to be.There are some small annoyances related to inventory management and weapon degradation, but I don't think they hinder the game much.If you've ever been interested in playing games, play this.

There is no need to own it twice, unless you are like me and you have to compete with your kids for time on one of your Nintendo consoles.Since I now own both a  Wii U and a switch the kids now own the Wii U copy and I own the Switch version!!!!  Good thing the switch is easy to hide :)",

Thats not hyperbole.  I adore OOT and just as it revolutionized 3D gaming when it was introduced, so has Breath of the Wild revolutionized open world gaming. It borrows a lot of concepts form past Zelda games and other open world games and prefects them. It sets the standard for how to create a truly open world, do ANYTHING, kind of game. The weapon durability system was an amazing fix to a myriad of issues that games like Skyrim and Fallout suffer from - mainly it allows for the world to stay open while still gating areas based on enemy difficulty (if you could keep the same level 50 sword all game you would sneak into the Castle, get a big sword, and just smash every small enemy on the map, making combat easy and stale.  It also prevents a player from constantly leaving the amazing exploration just to head back to town to sell off the weapons they picked up for cash.  I did that all the time in Skyrim and looting became the game.  I used the same powerful sword and just repaired it when needed.  I would then go sell everything else and continue.  No weapons to buy and sell and weapons constantly breaking means I stay in the wild, exploring and collecting the weapons my enemies drop and honestly, its so much more fun.  No grinding at that level. Plus, it encourages Korok seed exploration so you can increase inventory slots, it allows players to learn how to use all weapon types, it encourages using the environment for offense so you don't use your weapons as much and it encourages the use of meals/elixirs to add attack, defensive, and stealth buffs.  I honestly think its the most elegant solution to some bad open world problems and it encourages some fun and unique game play. The game has a few issues here or there, but its a perfect 5/5 and I couldn't possibly recommend it more.",

The game features a lot of customization. You can also cook a variety of different things�?which is really fun. The storyline is really easy to understand, especially for someone who hasn't played a game in The Legend of Zelda series before. It's also been one of the more challenging Zelda games in a long time. If I could combined three games to describe this game I would use Skyrim, fallout, and Minecraft. It has some elements from each of those games and of course it has the signature Zelda feel.

While there is a story line, you are free to go where you want, if you can survive!  Which leads into difficulty.  This game is not as easy as past Zelda games.  Weapons break, so you are constantly swapping them out.  The boomarang for example, you have to actively catch it when it comes back.  No more throw away and forget about it.  No hearts lying around, the crafting system lets you cook food to refill lost life.  The combat system is amazing, challenging, unforgiving, and rewarding.The story I have played so far is very good.  I am not sure how or where in the Zelda timeline this game fits, there are plenty theories around the internet though.  While games like Halo were enough to get people to buy an Xbox, this game is a system seller.  If you dont have the cash for a switch any time soon, pick this up on the Wii U if you have one.  Game is worth twice the asking price compared to the garbage Ubisoft and others have given us the past few years (though I hear Ubisoft is back on the up and up lately).",

This is definitely a departure of previous Zelda titles. This is an open world masterpiece where you can explore everything and everywhere. There’s no spaces where there will be empty or fluff, you can explore everywhere. A new addition was the voice acting which was welcomed and I think a great addition. The shrines were so fun and side quests were great and some difficult but for the most part the shrines were a bit easy but enjoyable. Somethings that may need improvement are the weapon system, where your weapons break pretty easily and it becomes frustrating but bearable. Also the bosses felt way too easy and casual to me. Even the final boss seemed extremely easy and maybe should’ve been a bit more challenging. Bottom line, this game is so great and will have you glued to your seat for hours and hours a day.

Too many games are plagued by being linear and needing to do X before you get to Y.  I love that Zelda gives you a quick intro and then basically tells you to \"have at it\" as it sends you out into it's gigantic world. It helps to produce that \"epic adventure\" feeling while playing the game.I feel like i've put a lot of time into the game until I look at my map and see how much of the world I still have left to see and explore.

The game plays its cards too early; except for four helpful but ultimately unnecessary abilities, the game gives you everything you're going to get right at the start, rather than parceled out like in the other 3D titles, but also without the amount of variety that Link Between Worlds had in its item rental system. As the game moves on, upgrading armors becomes a chore and the Master Sword is ultimately underwhelming. The 'Apparatus' puzzles are just generally awful. The bosses are too easy, and far from the most difficult enemies. The ending is so anti-climactic. BotW has some of the best dialogue writing of the series, especially in the side quests, but the voice actors for the cinematics are all so stilted and robotic.What the game does do well is innovate on a stale IP. There's less platforming overall, but the platforming there is is far more forgiving since the player now has much better control over jumping and gliding. The slow motion aiming mid-air is a fantastic touch. The ability to climb literally anything makes for an open world game that *actually* feels open world. Though I wish that some of the shrines had been more challenging, there was a great amount of variety in them. The combat learning curve is nearly perfect. And as someone who didn't give a rats patoot about the previous games' fishing mini-games, I loved the new bomb-fishing method. Of the two 'stealth' missions, one was fantastic - the other was a chore.Change is good and the franchise needs more of it, but it also needs to remember some old lessons again. I'm really torn between this and Windwaker as my top title in the series - BotW does open world far better, but Windwaker still beats it in so many other aspects.",

This game is still going to go down as a masterpiece in my humble opinion.The combat is less forgiving than in previous titles; if you throw a boomerang you must manually catch said boomerang. Going into a fight absent mindedly and thinking you'll reflex your way through it is also not going to end well for you.The puzzle solving is still here, but the dungeons are in greater number on average but with less of a time commitment individually. This does NOT take away from the feeling of epicness/adventure.Overall I still believe this game will be regarded as a masterpiece.",

The abundance of wildlife is phenomenal. The game is full of surprises.Also, Link SUCKS at swimming. It is a frustratingly slow pace and he drowns constantly.

I have Master sword. I am not ready to finish the game. I want to explore the shrines quests and stock up some more equipment. I have a house where I store weapons and shield. I am using 20 Amiibos (mostly from Smash Bros 3DS) for extra loots before I fight the final boss. Zelda is fun to play after getting like dozen ancient arrows. All four guardians are freed. I am trying to get the dragon parts for elixirs and leveling up armors with dragon parts and rare loots. I spent over 4 hours on snow ball bowling for coin farming to upgrade the house. I bought the cartridge version of Zelda because I didn't want to download and have some physical media to play on. So far, awesome game play. It's as intense at times vs Xbox One games like Metal Gear Solid to sneak on a large prey (wearing sneak suit). Basically, I bought the Nintendo Switch to play Zelda game.Aside from price of console and accessories like controller and microSD card to increase storage, the games and system performance are highly satisfactory. $300 for console, $60 for average games, $20 for average downloadable titles, $200 for 256 GB microSD card, $70 for pro controller ($140 for 2). $300, $280 for games: Zelda, Splatoon 2, Mario Rabbit, Mario Odyssey, Namco Museum, 1945, $200 microSD card, $140 for 2 pro controllers: grand total so far $920. I purchased the downloadable games using Nintendo Eshop by adding $200 to Eshop credit. Pricing reflects the volume sales. More they sell, cost goes down for consumer electronics. Contents of Mario and Zelda games are highly satisfactory. There was added cost of purchasing Nintendo Amiibo. I bought the Zelda Amiibos in retail and purchased rest of the Nintendo 3DS Smash Bros Amiibos on second hand market using craigslist and Facebook market. Total cost of having more than 20 Amiibos were $300: break down is $125 for Zelda set from a collector, and rest from another second hand seller who sold me in bulk which helps me with Zelda for getting free mushrooms and arrows. It saved me time to collect the mushrooms separately although collecting is pretty easy by just warping to Shrine nearby forest areas and snow fields for gourmet meat for coin farming as well as warping to snow ball bowling. Anyhow, all the titles are family friendly and less violent vs Xbox One S titles. Definitely price does hurt the wallet for Christmas. Aside from that I think it's worth to buy Switch. It's less painful than Wii U to transfer and load games from disc format. Console functions as a portable device as well. However, I forbid my household guests from taking it out of the docking station and only use it with LG 4K 55\" UHD LED television. 6.2 inch vs 55 inch is obvious. 1080p output from Nintendo Switch is seamlessly converted to 4K screen and game play is smooth without loading lag. I prefer using pro controller over joycon. I left the joycon attached the console and bought two pro controllers to play games. Usually, one pro controller is charging while other is being played with. I am using two pro controller for Mario Odyssey 2 Player mode. I am playing the hat. On Mario + Rabbid, we play the 2 player mode on team battles to earn coins for main quest weapons. Smash Brothers Amiibo came in handy for using on Zelda as well as Mario + Rabbid to add weapons and loots. Splatoon 2 allows Amiibos for special weapons and gears. Both instances of Amiibos added extra game play options and gave me satisfactions on investing on 20 Amiibos for overall life time of Switch gaming. I wrote this review after two months of game play on 6 games (4 major titles and 2 downloadable) and several official accessories were tested.",

    "review Text": "(no spoilers)It's no \"Ocarina of Time\" or even \"Majora's Mask\" but I gotta say, Breath of the Wild is great. IMO better than Wind Waker and Twilight Princess combined! I don't normally jump on the hype train but between the Nintendo Switch and Zelda, I decided to go for it. Now, I wouldn't say this is \"the greatest game of all time!!!!!\" like most claim but it is quite epic.Here's a detailed list of my likes/dislikes:Likes:+ Combat ~ the combat is incredibly smooth. It can be challenging at times, but easy to maneuver.+ Graphics ~ while the graphics may seem lacking at first, after a couple hours the game looks beautiful. It's definitely unique and looks good in both 720p and 1080p. (handheld vs tv mode)  Same goes for games like Wind Waker or Tell Tale TWD: after you get into the mindset, they look nice.+ Storyline ~ I haven't had a stale minute yet. The main storyline is interesting and it even has cinematics/cutscenes! (I'm hoping the main storyline is very long)+ Horses ~ I really dig the new horse system. I'll always love Epona but Epona2 will manage.+ Weapons ~ I love the fact that all weapons have durability. Yes, your weapon won't last forever and you will have to replace it (sometimes within a few swings) but this keeps the combat very fresh and interesting. AND there is a huge array of weapons which is fantastic any way you slice it. You will be forced to pick up a few tree branches from time to time.+ Cooking ~ the amount of different foods/supplies/recipes is nuts! Mix anything together and it will pop out a new recipe.+ Armor ~ woot! many different armor models with set bonuses! Even helmets :D+ Treasure Hunts ~ there are many different easter eggs/open world puzzles/etc out there. If you see something peculiar, go check it out. Odd's are, you will find something of rarity. It could be a strange looking landmark or a hidden hole in the ground, every moment is a breath of fresh air. I feel like I'm on survivor and keep spotting potential hidden immunity landmarks lol.+ Open World ~ this is a double edged sword IMO, I will explain below. However, one of the most jaw-dropping features of this game is how massive it is. Especially when its capable on a handheld. And the loading screens are rare yet speedy.Dislikes:- Soundtrack ~ this is severely lacking. Most of the game is quiet. Yes, its great hearing the sounds of nature all around you but most games have both.- Settings ~ I guess this applies to the Nintendo Switch as well but there are minimal settings to choose from. For example, there is an in-game tracker that makes beeping noises. I wanted to turn it down, however there are absolutely 0 audio settings. This means you cannot adjust music volume, dialog etc.- Controls ~ the controls are VERY funky compared to the average console. I don't understand why every platform insists on using a different layout but it makes it difficult for everyone. Zelda BOTW controls on a PS4 controller would look like this: X is the back button, Triangle is the sprint button, Circle is the interact button, Square is the attack button. You can change the controls very mildly, the settings only allow you to switch sprint with back (X vs Triangle). In this day and age, you should be able to map out any keybinds you wish.-  Played Time ~ again, for being 2017 without this feature is beyond me. Most games show you how long you've played your saved game. IE 7days 5hours etc. However, Zelda BOTW does not. This is a very convenient feature to have for, say, making a review. I haven't manually kept track of how long I've played unfortunately, it would be nice to be able to include that in my review.- Inventory Space ~ you do expand it eventually but, man, sometimes your weapons don't break fast enough in order to pick more up. You'll be constantly throwing your weps just to make room.- Side Quests ~ I haven't played a huge amount of time but as I've seen, I've wished there were more frequent side quests. My biggest concern with a game is blowing through a main storyline too quickly.- Camera ~ as I've said before, there are minimal settings to choose from. One of the options is to adjust camera sensitivity/speed, EXCEPT its missing two separate settings for vertical/horizontal camera speeds. It is combined (to the best of my knowledge). So in example, I am using the setting \"Fast\" but it is too fast for vertical panning yet way too slow for horizontal panning. This is a huge pain in the butt because if I adjust it to \"Very Fast\" then my horizontal camera speed will be good but the vertical camera speed will be uncontrollable.- Open World ~ its a like/dislike for me. Although, I love huge open worlds, there must be some order to a video game. BOTW seems to drop you into a world with little direction. Which, personally I enjoy but it's risky for losing interest faster. A goal is always needed, I've noticed sometimes that goal is hard to spot.Well, thats it. There are many more points I could touch but I may be ranting at this point. I hope I helped at least one person with this review! My overall statement would be to give this game a fighting chance. Ignore the hype, ignore the name \"Zelda\" slapped on the cover. Just play the game with no reservations. If you like it, you like it. In my opinion, the first hour or two was a little dull. I almost let the hype disappoint me but after playing a few more hours, I really started to enjoy it. And now each day that I continue to play it, I get more hooked. It was well worth shelling out the bucks for a Nintendo Switch+accessories AND breath of the wild.This is a 5 star game! Recommended!...but 4 stars because of the lack of settings mostly...and also my Zelda:BOTW game box came cracked, it is missing one of the latches completely so the game case doesn't stay closed. In addition, it wasn't sealed. It was loosely covered in plastic that had clearly been opened. Used or not, it works just fine so I can't complain. (okay maybe a little lol)",

    "review Text": "I want to start off by saying that this is the first Amazon Review I've ever written, so I hope it's of some use to at least one individual that stumbles upon it.Before I go into praising BotW I'd like to mention that there are frequent frame rate dips when playing the game on the Switch while docked. In handheld mode, this problem is all but nonexistent. Yes, there are times where it is noticeably annoying, but I would not go as far as to say that you shouldn't purchase this incredible game because of this issue.The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for the Nintendo Switch is a marvel to behold.Gameplay:The LoZ plays smoothly and responsively. When I first wrapped my fingers around the joy-cons and played this game, I felt like the placement of some of the commands felt a little out of place. Aside from the placement of the jump button (which can be changed) that forces you to claw the controller in order to run and jump, you end up getting used to the button layout. Unfortunately, there are a few connectivity issues with the joy-cons that Nintendo needs to improve upon, but if you're playing with a Pro Controller (highly recommended) than you won't need to worry about that. There are so many unique ways to combine food and other items in order to come up with creative dishes and elixirs to aid you during your journey. The combat is what you'd expect from a Zelda game, but with the inclusion of weapon durability and variety, no encounter is similar to the next. Also, Link can now scale almost anything due to a new climbing mechanic. It is the best feeling to climb up large mountains and look down at the gorgeous world that Nintendo has created for us. Sometimes you will reach the top of something just before running out of stamina, and I can honestly say that moments like these are what make the game feel so special.Difficulty:I wanted to touch on this a little bit because I for one don't consider many of the Zelda games to be especially difficult in terms of combat encounters, but this new entry changes that. If you're fighting multiple enemies at once, be prepared with a strategy beforehand or else get your butt handed to you. Enemies down the line will give you a hard time for sure.Environment:Breath of the Wild is a gorgeous game and saying that still doesn't do it justice. The art style fits perfectly with the series. The world is beautiful, vibrant, and very much alive. There will be moments where you'll just stop and enjoy the sunset just because of how much the weather impacts you throughout the game. After an entire night trying to climb cliffs in the rain, the sun rising and sky clearing is a brief moment of reprieve. The wildlife and assortment of plant life is extremely expansive in terms of diversity and uniqueness. There is just so much to look at. Not to mention, the map itself is HUGE! I've clocked almost 30 hours into the game and there are still many areas i have yet to explore. It's exciting to think about!Story and Characters:It's a Zelda game so you probably already know what to expect, but I think Nintendo has upped the game in this regard even still. The characters are each likable in their own way, and the relationships they have with each other make you enjoy the game even further. I don't want to go into too much detail about that for fear of spoilers but just know that the events of this story impact the characters in ways that give you an inviting insight into their emotions.Music and Voice Acting:The music is miraculous. Most of the time throughout your journey the only thing you will hear is the sounds... of nature. Birds chirping, deer running, horses galloping, rain falling, and lightning cracking. It's amazing! Of course when you enter a town or other occupied area, that's when the BotW soundtrack truly shines.This is the first time a Zelda game has included voice acting, and I'm here to tell you that you won't be disappointed. You will be very judgmental of the vocal performances at first, but that's only because it's SO WEIRD hearing real voices come from the characters that you've grown to know and love over the years. Once you get over that initial surprise you will begin to appreciate the performances, which I believe to be very well done. I absolutely love Zelda's voice actress. I was never a huge fan of the character myself, but I've adopted a whole new appreciation of the character by the way she's portrayed in this game.To wrap things up, I'd like to say that this game might be one of the few games ever created that is a MUST PLAY for anyone that's a fan of video games. It's just a fun, beautiful, memorable, and unique experience that anyone watching/playing can admire.I've played many incredible video games in my lifetime, but The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the only one that forced me to write an Amazon Review.I'm absolutely positive that you will be 'blown away' by The Breath of the Wild ;)",

That might give my review more value, since I didn't really have the level of hype that most fans did and my perception of how the game actually is wasn't potentially clouded by excitement.  What I like so far about BOTW is how atmospheric it is. When your not fighting monsters, it's so quiet you can hear the trees rustling or birds chirping. It just gives you that sense of 'calm before the storm.'  I also like how your not bombarded too heavily with side quests and tedious tasks that have put me off with other open world games. You really do feel like you can do whatever you want and you have so many options available to you like when it comes to attacking a Bokoblin camp.  On the other hand, it does bug me how often your weapons break, but that's not so much a problem I have, as much as it's just an aspect of the game that ensures your constantly getting new equipment. It definitely sucks when your surrounded by enemies and your sword breaks 😳.  Overall, I am really enjoying the game even though I don't typically like open world games, and I haven't played a lot of the Zelda franchise.

The game makes traveling exciting by rewarding your patience, but also not making it too hard to find anything. I've never seen such a well-made world in a video game before this.I find the combat in this game to be reminiscent of the first Legend of Zelda in the sense that it is challenging. You can't just run at a large group of enemies and expect to come out unscathed. And as a player you get a great feeling of progression from developing combat skills and strategies. This is also one of the few games where sometimes stealth is the most fun option. And it's because the game doesn't tell you to sneak around. Instead it might present you with an enemy that you probably can't beat and let you make the decisions from there.It is such an immersive game. In many adventure games, the story feels set in stone, as if you as the player are just fulfilling check points that have to be there. In this game, you are eased into the story without too much exposition, and from there you can go straight to the final boss if you so desire. You will most definitely lose, but you can do it. Alternatively, you could go where the main quest takes you to try to prepare, or you could just do your own thing. The game truly makes you the protagonist because after the first ~10-30 minutes, it doesn't force you to do anything. You are the decision-maker with a vast world around you.The one and only major flaw in this game is the dungeons. They just aren't as exciting as the overworld and lack the combination of puzzles and combat that made Zelda dungeons so iconic. But, they are actually a relatively small part of the game and though they aren't particularly exciting, they aren't boring.This is the best game I have played in a long time. I strongly recommend it.",

This is also in contrast to western open world titles like Skyrim where seemingly every character is bland and a chore to talk to.If I were to pick out a few flaws; the frame rate sometimes drops in docked mode, some of the shrines are significantly weaker than others, and I could've used a bit more music - especially in the shrines where there's only one music track.

Horrendously low durability. You will often break your weapon before a single fight is over, or maybe multiple weapons. And you have limited weapon slots. The real kicker is many clever puzzle solutions require that you have a certain type of weapon on hand (A hammer, axe and korok leaf are often required) but with the harshly limited slots AND extremely low durability, you'll find yourself carrying 5 different weapons that you don't even like because everything you DO enjoy fighting with is broken in seconds! And yes, even the master sword breaks. No joke!-- They've broken tradition and left the grandiose music of yesteryear behind. I want my Saria's Song and Song of Storms, Song of Time, Song of Healing, Midna's Song, etc back! Hyrule isn't the same with dull, passive music playing instead of deeply immersive tunes I still find myself unconsciously humming DECADES after playing those games.Otherwise the game is fantastic. A little too childish with certain characters (the Zora's are sickening!), but it's Zelda and I'm an old man now so of course I'd say that (Majora's Mask, where art thou?). Great challenge - I play with only base-3 heart containers, have fun kids - clever puzzles and a wonderful world to explore. So close to perfect... but the weapon breaking is a terrible, terrible, at times even crippling design choice (you can be totally unable to fight if there are enough enemies at once).",

You literally don’t have to do any of the rest of the story. All of the big parts are optional! You don’t have to get the Master Sword, you don’t have to recover all of Link’s lost memories. You don’t even have to recover the divine beasts and put your friends�?spirits at rest.

I liked the dungeons, I liked the item requirements for certain areas. None of this “rune�?bullshit. I don’t like how my weapons break.**END SPOILER**This is a good game. I have put like 200 hours into it. It’s just not a good Zelda game. Most of the elements associated with Zelda are gone. It feels like someone took characters named Impa, Link, and Zelda and just tossed them in a completely different genre of game and expected it to come out to be a good Zelda title. It’s not. Regardless, it was a fun game and I don’t regret my purchase.",

    "review Text": "So now that I pissed off everyone with my title, on with the review.Breath of the Wild surprised me because as the title says, I don't really like Zelda games. They never clicked with me for one reason or another. Which is funny because clones like Darksiders and Beyond Oasis on the Sega Genesis, I love! But I really have been enjoying this game. I really like Twilight Princess, that's the one I can say I enjoyed the most and love. I enjoyed the characters, the growth between Link and Midna, seeing her develop as a character really won me over.I know a lot of people don't like durability because ...they like their games simple and dull, but it really keeps combat interesting in this game. You will be swapping weapons often whether you like it or not, they also function differently with attack values, durability, swing speed and how you can maneuver.This game was obviously inspired by the likes of Skyrim and Farcry, you need to cook to make better healing items and they can even have special effects to resist the weather. It's not complex either and even me who doesn't care for this finds it simple and quick. Get ingredients, find a pot, light a fire, dump in, fud is dun. The Farcry inspiration is...the towers and random dungeons you can find. But they're not as frequent, useless and annoying. They managed to do what Ubisoft did, but make it good. Who knew. Thank you Nintendo for understanding that FUN is priority in a game and not irritating padding. Oh, also fire spreading is a fun mechanic they took and I'd say improved on in many ways. I wouldn't say climbing the towers but the trials offer interesting challenges with good variety to themIt's not perfect, the controls can be a bit finicky with powers and personally I find it hard to maneuver. Also, despite a patch it has some massive framedrops due to its vsyncing. The game runs at 30fps, if there's slowdown it drops to 20 and it's very obvious. Now before you comment saying \"that's not important, wah wah wah\" it's a flaw, low framerates strain my eyes as it is and yes it's not frequent, it's uncommon at best but it's still worth noting. I have very sensitive eyes and frame drops on a small screen I'm focused on does wear on my eyes.The other issue is load times are pretty heavy, they vary from 10-40 seconds depending on the area you are loading into. But even dying, the load time is pretty harsh. While some may argue they know of other games with similar load times, that's not a positive thing. The shining light in this is with standby mode you don't need to load back into the game if you have put the system into sleep mode or hopped out of the game to go to the e-shop or something.Combat is great, maybe the best it's ever been. You can do ztargeting or ...don't, play more like an action game, it does help, especially with some moves being required to ztarget (I think?) but it adds to it. As I said, durability has you switching weapons and using a variety of them to get by and it makes it fun, for me anyway. Weapon about to break? Fling it at the enemy! See a fire? Light your arrow and shoot it at a field of grass, fire!There's random encounters and FINALLY a game with no difficulty/level scaling. Wander into the wrong neck of the woods? You'll find strong ass enemies that will happily punch your face in faster than you can say \"MuscularSheikahAreSexy\"Is this game worth playing? Yes. At the time of writing this is the only must have Switch game (the others are either not my thing or they're too expensive), if you have a WiiU and you're not interested in a Switch? Get it on that, ignore the rumors. It runs just as well, the framerate dips happen in different areas and it also may be patched. It runs well and looks great in tablet or TV mode. Again, I am FAR from a die-hard Zelda fan but I do find this game fun and I imagine fans of Zelda may get more mileage out of it than me. Like Skyrim? Zelda? ....Farcry...? You'd probably dig this game.",

It's going to do extra damage when it breaks, but then you're not going to have a weapon anymore, so there's that.You've picked up probably a hundred and fifty weapons over the two hours you've been playing, and every one of them has broken.  You think fondly of the one that lasted three battles.  That was fine craftsmanship, you think, as you pick up a club some dead goblin just dropped and hit another goblin with it and the game tells you your weapon is badly damaged and it's going to break.You've tried to account for this, but your inventory is limited to a handful of melee weapons, and no matter how many times you shoot somebody with a bow, every fight ends up being a melee fight.  Also, your bow just broke.Also, your club just broke.This game is an impressive technical achievement that is incredibly playable and fun and interesting and you found a new sword and the game just told you it's about to break.  Breath of the Wild will keep you coming back for hours, maybe days—like it did me—with a vast and varied world to explore and the sword you picked up a minute ago just broke.It sort of makes sense--this is postapocalyptic Hyrule, where even the tripods from War of the Worlds are mostly just broken-down wrecks (that will still kill you because it takes forty or fifty weapons' worth of hits to kill them and you can only carry six) but given the number of critters there are to kill and the rate at which weapons break (and yours just broke) you're really starting to wonder how they didn't run out of weapons about 13 minutes after the apocalypse all this is supposed to be post-.Overall, you think as your weapon breaks, this would be a five-star game--probably one of the best games of all time if not *the* best--if they had addressed some balance issues before it shipped, like how often your weapons break.By the way, your weapon just broke.",

The first game I bought for my switch was lego city undercover because I was interested it the game regardless of the platform it was on.  I went and purchased Zelda in part due to a lack of games for the switch, and because it was an open world action adventure.Presentation:  I think the game is very attractive, do not really see any flaws and it runs well.  My issue is with everything else.  There is not much music and not much of it is memorable.  Not many spoken lines with mostly reading which I am normally fine with but with all the high praise I thought this game would have more spoken lines.  Sound effects are fine.Gameplay:  Is solid with all the buttons being used for different actions and a lot of different ways to conquer an opponent.  I don’t feel like the game does a lot unique but the package is tight and the animations smooth.  The land is pretty barren overall so that is why the draw distance is really good because not much to render.  I can’t stand the weapon mechanic with them always breaking.  I don’t mind weapon breaking over time but when you are in a short fight with 1 enemy and it barely last then getting a new weapon does not bring much excitement.  There are also a great many fetch quest that seem to only lengthening the game than add any depth to it.Conclusion:  I like the story, although not told in a deep way, It is a good one that gives you purpose.  The game is overrated to me as I see this as an 80-85 type of game.  There is just nothing that is outstanding about this game. I feel it is solid but with the weapon breaking, fairly empty world, boring fetch quests and what you have is a good game not amazing at all.Update: After playing it for a bit I realized I'm not having much fun.  I start to see this game as a justification to enjoy the switch, like I was pushing myself to play it. What really decided it for me though was playing Horizon Zero Dawn and having a blast and then trying to come back to Zelda.",

The there is the beast temples which are short and boring. Then there is the weapon system stuff breaks and you have to keep stopping in the middle of a fight to pick another dam weapon. So much empty space and no exciting bosses. I'm a huge legend of Zelda fan main reason bought the switch just for this game did not live up to my expectations.",

It absolutely blew me away at that the time and for many years after through Ocarina of Time I couldn't get enough Zelda but for a few generations (Gamecube/Wii/Wii U) I haven't enjoyed much of what was putting out including Zelda.  Now as I'm a bit older with more disposable income I decided to preorder the Switch and Breath of the Wild to give Nintendo ONE more try.  I am so happy I did because this is hands down the best game I've played on any current generation system.I finished Final Fantasy XV recently and had a blast but it was by no means perfect.  I then picked up Horizon Zero Dawn thinking it would keep me  busy for weeks if not months to come but unlike most who have enjoyed the game I just didn't get into it.  This is what brings me to the new Zelda, it might not be a graphical powerhouse but as a game it is so much more fun in terms of gameplay alone that everything else suddenly pales in comparison. Showing that at the end of the day it isn't just about resolution.  Heck, I have the Switch hooked up to a 4K Sony Bravia (75\") and Breath of the Wild looks beautiful.  If you have a Switch right out of the gate then this is a no-brainer.  There isn't much more out there and this is the must own title.It has been quite a few years since I would consider myself a Nintendo fanboy but with this one title alone Nintendo has made me a believer again.",

Also there aren't that much monster diversity or challenge to them either other than the few bosses here and there. It's a great game but not as challenging as the previous Zelda games. I think it deserves a slightly above average score but it could be rounded down to 3 stars especially if you have high expectations.",

But bear with me:This game has hours, and I say HOURS of gameplay, I have about 120 hrs played by the time I write this review and I haven't even explored half the map. It has amazing scenery, likable and relatable characters, a powerful story and a lot of easter eggs and side quests. I do, however, agree that the weapon system is quite frustrating in the first few hours of gameplay, but once you start getting the hang of it it's not a hassle anymore.So, if you're a completionist, or you've got ADD like me, this is going to be a long journey because you will get lost just goofing around, or exploring and climbing and trying to get to every little corner in this game's vast world. So if you want a lot of frenetic action or a fast-paced game this is probably not a game for you, and probably not any Zelda game for that matter... You could try to go to fight Ganon right away and see how you do, I believe some frenetic action would be in place lol.",

It is a great game, but not even one of the top 3 Zelda games in my opinion.Pro'sOpen world+truly a huge world.  absolutely massiveTons of exploration+120 shrines, each is 1-2 rooms of a traditional Zelda gameTons of mini questsActual voice acting for about 10-15% of main story (none for link, and there are still large walls of text to read).Cons (IE, things people overlook when giving it a perfect score-Graphical popping, texture issues, slow down when near big/numerous enemies  The switch isn't really that powerful and it struggles here on a launch title.  This has me a little worried for the console.- All those quests...95% reward you with 100-300 rupees. But the things you actually spend money on cost 1000-10,0000.  And many quests take 30+ minutes.  So you spend an hour doing 2 quests for 200 rupees.  It feels very unrewarding.-Very very very small story.  You get Intro 4 shrines, 4 main town dungeons, and last boss.  Super speed runs aside, you can beat the full story in about 5-10 hours.  You're supposed to supplement that time with all of the side quests, but see above.- Dungeon wise, you have 4 small (by Zelda standards) dungeons and then 1 massive dungeon with the last boss.  I am accustomed to 8-10 dungeons in a Zelda game so this was super short.- You start the game with all of your tools.  I loved the old style of new tools in new dungeons unlocking new areas.  Starting with everything makes the 4 dungeons you do seem less important.------The biggest issue for me, weapons and shields break.  So you have to constantly stock up on more.  I have never cared for games with limited durability weapons/armors.  You like that shiny new sword?  Aw, it broke one enemy later.  Even the master sword breaks...though it does regenerate after 10 minutes without it.",

Why is it out of stock everywhere, and scalper's paradise where available ?- Bargaining: Ok. Be strong. It will go down in price. Before the birthday. You have time. Plenty. Sorta.- Depression: No, it won't. No, you don't. No time. At all.- Acceptance: Yes, I will wait in line in front of Best Buy. Or Walmart. Or something. Wait. You're a New Yorker. There's no Walmarts in NYC. But wait. There's a Nintendo Store. Yeayyy...What about the game, you'll ask ?Who cares ?!? Your kid will like it. You will in the beginning shiver at the concept that the concept of \"rich game world\" can make more noise than any version of GTA, will cry at the idea that in a time when \"Unravel\" is a few years old such graphics can still exist, but it will go away.

I actually don't care as much about losing weapons as I do about having to swap out in the middle of a battle when one breaks.  Cooking is interesting, but WAY to tedious cooking up a bunch.  Having to wade through all of the materials and wait through the cooking animation is annoying.  Skipping the animation doesn't even save time.  Having a huge world is ok, but having to cross that huge world is tedious.  Fast travel is good, but I'd rather traveling by horse be a bit easier.  Just letting us call the current horse from wherever we are regardless of distance from the horse would help.  Being able to register a horse at more locations rather than having to travel so much out of your way.  As it is, I never use a horse because I don't want to go so far out of my way to get it.But, it is fun and the characters are interesting.  Having played lots of Zelda games it is cool to see references to other games and see old characters and monsters show up in a different form.

While you're trying to fight a boss your weapons keep breaking. You have to stop in the middle of the battle to replace them and then eat f'ing food to replenish your hearts. Then if the boss doesn't beat you with one almighty strike the view is terrible and has you in the wrong direction. By the time you find your bearing and face the boss again it's time for another almighty strike and your either dead or down to almost no power. There's so many buttons to do different things that are needed at certain times you can never keep track. So you hit the wrong button and guess what?? That's right another almighty one shot strike that almost or does completely end your life again. I got so mad I twisted the controller. i wanted to chew on it and swallow it so I could poop it out later on. At certain points it's basically impossible to make it to certain area's without special clothing, powers or weapons. And there's no way you'll ever find out how to obtain these things without again differing to youtube videos.

    "review Text": "How do you make the Legend of Zelda relevant again? By destroying the definition of what a game like the Legend of Zelda is supposed to be. Where do I start with this game? How about the fact you really go can anywhere you want- horizontally and vertically. How about the fact the physics in this game actually matter and you can truly manipulate and approach every situation differently because of it. How about adding voice acting and cutscenes and some of the best writing I have ever read in a video game?I don't know where to begin(just like the game). I have been preparing for a hardcore open world game in Hyrule for years. I knew that eventually, Nintendo would take Zelda in this direction so I needed to prepare myself. It all started with Portal 1 and 2, then Skyrim, then the Last of Us, then the Souls series and Bloodborne. Each of the game series I listed you can see influenced the final product. From the quick, challenging and fun puzzles( just like Portal) in the shrines and dungeons. The open world discovery from Skyrim, the survival aspect and utilizing all your resources like the Last of Us, and the difficult but rewarding enemy and boss encounters like the Souls series.It also borrows from the Ubisoft model of climbing a tower to open up a portion of the map but unlike the Ubisoft model nothing shows up on the map. You need to find and mark the locations you need to explore. I play with HUD off which helps me really learn the environment and look at the map like a true adventure. It is so refreshing to venture off into a large land mass because you see something in the horizon. I spent 4 hours last night just exploring and find new secrets that I missed in the beginning area. I am currently in the eastern part of the map and I had a feeling in my gut I needed to go back to where it all started since I had new equipment and understood the world design better. Man, I beat two Guardians, got 15 Korok seeds, finish 8 shrines and just discovered parts of the map that are wonderous.If you want your hand to be held and everything to be easy, this game is not for you. It is not as hard as a Dark Souls or Bloodborne but you can make it that hard if you want by venturing into areas with underpowered equipment. This game has spoiled me. I can't look or play other games now if the gameplay isn't tight and the world isn't magical. I play games to lost myself and forget about the issues of my life and the world. I don't care about graphics. I want to have fun, I want a challenge. I want to use my brain as well as my skills to get through a tough area or boss. Every time I fail, I know it is because of me. Either I am rushing, not mentality ready for the fight, or overlooking an aspect of the game.This game is easily in my top 5 favorite games of all time. Not sure of the rankings yet but I worry for Portal 2 and FF7. That's it- go out and get it. The Wii U is the only Nintendo system I never owned. The Switch is fantastic. I do recommend a pro controller. I use the pro controller for tough fights since I need the dexterity. But I play on the handheld when I just want to explore areas with enemies I know I can beat while looking for new shrines to complete. If you don't have money for a console and one of the greatest games ever just wait till the Holidays. But if you are like me and hate cookie cutter games like Ubisoft open-world games(Rayman Legends is awesome) then please go get this game. You will not regret it.Update: What I said above is true about this game up to a certain point. I just beat the main story, 90 shrines, 150 korok seeds and good amount of side quests completed. First off, I hate Calamity Ganon and everything Hyrule Castle. It is the worst part of the game. I will not ruin the game here but for a game where you spend 80-90 hours being creative and doing different puzzles, this area is not creative and just a fight fest. I did not struggle with any of the battles before Ganon but you can avoid them all if you wish. There are no puzzles to get to Ganon. It was the most disappointing boss battle in the game.I have dropped the score to a 4.5 because the mini bosses on the world map are always fun, everything else is fun in the game but I would recommend beating the game either as soon as possible or doing everything else before facing Ganon. I just cannot play any longer. After 115 hours, I felt it was time to beat Ganon. Those 5 hours walking to the castle, and telling I will not skip any area to get to Ganon felt like a chore. Still a fantastic game that suffers from the usual RPG issue of overstaying its welcome and having lackluster final boss.Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Wind Waker, A Link to the Past are all still better games since they did not leave me with this sour taste at the end. I might change my mind in the future but this is my fresh update after watching the credits.",

I found around 10 in my time with the game and all of them were fun, clever and original.-The world is vast and beautiful.  Hunting and searching for materials is fun and addictive.Bad:-The combat is frustrating and annoying.  Any regular enemy can kill you with two hits, but they can take significant damage before dying.  What makes things worse, the weapons break with extreme ease.  Not only that, but defeating enemy camps is often not worth it.  I would use three weapons to clean out the camp, to get one weapon from the chest.  Furthermore, Link doesn't earn experience points from fighting.  So it is easier to simply avoid the camps.  Anyhow, I hope this helps.",

    "review Text": "Fantastic Game but not quite as good the reviews it's getting. I really enjoyed this game a lot.  I've been playing Zelda games from the very first one and this is in the top 3 without question.  But I can't give it 5 stars.  Why?It doesn't follow the traditional game-play of Zelda.  In BOTW, the entire world is open to you early on in the game.  You can go anyplace you want.  My problem with it is that I think they took it a bit too far with that concept. I really missed having to search for large hidden dungeons, full of numerous enemies, in which you found special tools and items needed to progress further in the world.  I feel that the open world concept is probably more enticing to newer players of the series but it disregards a very important part of what makes a Zelda game.The durability system annoys me.  You should be allowed to use your weapons more than 10 times before breaking, unless it's a tree branch.  Repairing equipment should have been a feature.Low variation of enemies.  I will say that the enemies in the game are great.  The AI is very good but there just isn't enough of them.Controls are a bit strange and not intuitive.  It took me hours before I could finally battle without hitting the wrong button or switch weapons correctly.  I'm so glad there is an option to change the jump and run button because that would have been a huge problem for me.Lack of a soundtrack!  Wheres my classic Zelda songs?  Sometimes you hear faint songs that you recognize but for the most part it's very quiet.  You will just walking  then you will hear like 3 notes on a piano...dun dun duuuuun!...and that's it.  There should have been full soundtrack in this game.Minor performance issues.  Frame rate is good for the most part but it does suffer in some areas of the world.  Kind of disappointing for a new system release.I really loved everything else about the game including the silent protagonist!  The cooking concept was excellent, physics of the game, overall world design, weather, lighting, NPC interactions, pretty much everything else is 5 stars.  I feel like graphically the world and environment was perfection but the game play and mechanics were not.BOTW is certainly the most beautiful Zelda game to date and includes many new concepts and features but falls short of the title of \"Masterpiece\". It may be the game of the year, but it's not the best game in the series.",

    "review Text": "I realize that I'm in the minority, but I really hate this game.I am not a hardcore Nintendo fan, but I really do like the Zelda games, and I've played all of them except Skyward Sword.I also work 60-70 hours a week, and as much as I want to enjoy my free time I found it impossible to do when playing this game.The developers give you an open world, but the primary activities are hunting and climbing which get old fast. There are simple climbing and gathering missions that would normally take the player 5 minutes or so, but \"random\" rain sets in and makes it impossible to progress with your task. I've literally had Link standing on the side of a mountain for multiple in-game days on end waiting for the rain to clear up. This is an extremely lazy attempt by the devs to make the game feel more substantial than it is. If someone has boasted about playing BOTW for X hours, I promise you they've spent at least 0.6X of those hours waiting for rain to go away.Guardians also suck. They are OP, their design and backstory don't make any sense in the narrative, and they feel like another tacked-on addition to trick the consumer into thinking the game has depth. Fighting them is next to impossible without blowing through all of your arrows and melee weapons. You also have to be incredibly dexterous to avoid their one-shot attacks.As an illustration of one of my evenings with this game:I see a shrine off in the distance. I decide to tackle it. Over the span of 20 minutes or so, I make my way across the map and begin scaling the final large cliff to reach the shrine. 10 minutes into my climb, rain sets in, I lose my footing and 10 minutes of progress. 20 real minutes later the rain subsides and I begin to trek again. 10 minutes into my climb, rain sets in for a second time forcing me to quickly navigate to lose only 5 minutes of climbing this time. 10 minutes pass and the rain subsides. I climb for 20 minutes, finally reaching the shrine.Total time: 1.5 hours to walk across part of the map to where I wanted to be. Nothing memorable, exciting, or fun happened in that span of time.I enter the shrine. There's a Guardian. Long story short, I bludgeon him within an inch of his life before his laser eye kills me. No amount of dodging, running, dancing, or heart replenishing will save me. I read tips online about how to deal with this particular Guardian to no avail. The laser hits me dead center in the middle of a dodge if it has to, and it's always a one-shot kill. This happens 17 times over the course of about 2 hours. The most terrifying thing about the fight wasn't even the laser, it was the god-awful controls. Using the Joycons, intense fights have you pushing just hard enough on the movement stick to force Link into a crouch which completely changes his movement and evasive capabilities to the effect that crouching in this fight is basically a death sentence. The depression sensor on the movement stick is too sensitive for this game. Nintendo should have remapped crouch somewhere else (or made a better controller). Evading works sporadically at best, and Link failed to even face or target the Guardian 9/10 times, even if I was standing within melee distance. The devs put in an extremely broken combat system and made the Guardian fights require very precise inputs sustained without failure over an extended length of time. I would venture to guess that any player who says he's played BOTW for X hours has probably spent 0.2X - 0.3X of those hours trying to kill just a handful of Guardians.Total time: 3.5 hours. Nothing to show for it. I had no fun getting to the shrine, and I got brutally murdered repeatedly.In conclusion, the game is as boring as it is repetitive, alternating between mindless fetch quests and tasks that are next to impossible to complete given shoddy workmanship in designing player control systems. The game plays like it wasn't  tested before market release. If the idea of spending 4+ hours in one sitting playing a game with no substance, memorable moments, or sense of improvement sounds like your cup of tea, by all means, buy this game today.Thankfully, I bought used so Nintendo didn't make any money off of me. The experience has encouraged me to disconnect my Switch and re-evaluate its continued position in my household. This game is a sham, and I'm only seeing crappy ports and un-imaginative original games on the future release calendar. Not a good outlook.",

    "review Text": "When I first picked up this game, I quite literally didn't want to put it down. It is extremely enjoyable to explore this giant world of Hyrule for the first time with a combat feel like that of \"A Link to the Past.\" It was both a fresh experience and an extremely nostalgic one for me as I've played most Zelda titles since the Super Nintendo. It is so open and there is so much to do at first that you won't know which direction to go.And then you find about 50 shrines. And you break a million weapons. And you defeat 2 bosses that each have a very familiar formula for getting to them and fight them. And you've had to cook so much food that you get sick of keeping your inventory stocked. And then you've upgraded about 4 armor sets and are constantly switching back and forth to get the right benefits for the situation you're in.Frankly, since I beat this game I have had very little reason to pick it up again. It is fun every once in a while for a casual stroll through Hyrule fighting a few monsters along the way and perhaps finding a new secret, but I don't really need to find the strongest horses when I've barely used one to begin with. And the rare weapons will just break, so who cares about those? And what do I need to find all the Korok Seeds for when I already have more space in my inventory than I need to defeat the most challenging monsters and spaces in the game?I'm not sure if it's just too easy or too little content or tedious game mechanics or a combination of all of these, but I don't think this game has a very great replay value. It's a beautiful game, but with a story/content spread so thin over such a long area, it really just gets boring by the end of it. Unless you just want to take pictures of Link and scenery; I suppose there's plenty of room for that.",

EDIT Mar 2019: I’m reviewing old reviews, I wasn’t very discriptive for a game review, I’ll add more..So the game itself looks pretty good, but I just felt disconnected from the story. I was in 8th grade when Ocarina of Time cameout. That game blew me away, and I was heavily invested. I’ve never felt so connected or enjoyed a game where it felt like a true adventure. I was hoping to get that same feeling almost 20 years later.That didn’t happen. Instead, I was playing a game that felt complete different from the old Zelda games I remembered. I felt so disconnected from it. People rave about this game, but to me, it was an empty world. the idea that you’re weapons broke was annoying. I don’t understand why they strayed away from the basic concepts of Zelda. I eventually find the Master Sword trough an annoying side quest. That breaks too, but you’re able to reuse it after a short time. Double-U Tee Eff.To me, this game was a horrible reach into some world that tried to match current adventure games. The open world concept with the ability to do all kinds of new things. For me, classic games are best sticking to basics. The risk that was taken to make it different was a stupid idea.I can’t tell you how many times I sat there wondering an empty land, occasionally finding bad guys, looking for the puzzle temples to get skill points to upgrade Link. I just wanted to stop plying, but felt compelled to beat it first. After I beat it, I never touched it again.",

Just the little things like climbing trees for apples, enemies picking up your weapon if you dropped it and attack you with it. To the hauntingly beautiful music and in depth world. Everything they say is true but some things most reviewers leave out. There is a big negative about this game.It reaches for the stars graphics wise. It really does it's best to max out the Switches graphic performance. I respect that but what happens is performance issues at times. Maybe it is because I am a PC gamer by hart but I feel performance issues like this should be a negative. It happens when docked, and when not docked.The Wii U it preforms better. Much better in fact they are pretty cheap right now so it is your best option to play this game in my opinion. But there are still issues there. So yes you could argue a game preforming uneven on console is more the fault of the console but It really is the developers issues.Twilight Princess and the Wind Walker (both masterpieces) never did this. I would argue both those games are better than The Legend of Zelda and were not tied to a system with big question marks. Gamecube is well loved - I know I loved  mine. The Wii I wasn't a fan of but it did what it said out to do no problems like the Switch - was a massive success 100 million sold.My point is Zelda is like Bethesda games, they always get glowing scores despite flaws. You get a feeling that people love these franchises so much they don't care about flaws. Which isn't wrong but it stops them being realistic for everyone else. Also I feel the Switch and Wii U really hold this game back.For instance there was a HD Zelda demo back in 2012 involving the Wii U. It looked amazing and ran at 1080p (I dream of 4k Zelda myself). But with the Switch it really holds back these graphics and art direction. Which is sad because we can all agree 1080p Zelda would be great and 4k would be mind blowing.Look the game is great, just under or just as good as the best Zelda titles of all time. But it isn't without flaws, and isn't my game of the year. But what do I know? I thought Darksouls 3 should have gotten game of the year last year, that Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2 deserved consideration. I thought Overwatch was above average - yet it won game of the year everywhere.Pros+ Everything you would come to expect from a Zelda game and then some+ Art direction+ music+ inventory system+ combat mechanics+ loot in the world+ NPCs+ Story+ PuzzlesCons- uneven performance at times- tied to a system with technical flaws and reported issues- tied to an old system no longer supported- very high price point to play one game - maybe better to waitGradeAConclusionI am not saying Zelda isn't amazing that provides in depth, original gameplay, few others games can dream of, I am not even saying it isn't a masterpiece to a degree. My only point is it's a flawed masterpiece where as some older Zelda games don't have those flaws. That isn't an insult my favorite game maybe of all time is Vampire: The Masquerade �?Bloodlines another flawed masterpiece.I can't imagine any Zelda fan disappointed with this game.",

The graphics are as smooth as butter.  And sometimes breathtakingly beautiful.  They went to great lengths to make it feel like the great outdoors.I am giving the game a proper chance.  This is the first Zelda that I believe to be significantly better than Ocarina of Time because of its freedom.  However there are so many thematically dissonant elements.  To me it seems wildly presumptuous of Aonuma to say that to him this is the definitive Zelda game.  That is not true.  Because it is not a good Zelda game.  It is a good Zelda-flavored open world western RPG.  Gone are the catchy tunes, the unlocking of new abilities (it's almost entirely front-loaded), the mind-blowing moments.  Most secrets are ho-hum.  Destroying Ganon is, almost insultingly, just another quest in your adventure log.  Yes you can climb over everything and there is no sequence to break but so what?  If there is any drama it has to be generated in your imagination.  This does not have the slightly cinematic feeling of the old 2D games, and next to none of the excessive cinematic feeling of the previous 3D games, because nothing in the game world actually changes over time except if a thing has \"been completed\", but nothing affects another thing, it all just adds to your stats and list of accomplishments.  At least in the original game, you acquired items that would in effect change the landscape.  When you got all 8 Triforce pieces, you felt like an important culmination occurred and the door to Hell opened.  In LttP the state of the town, the forest, and the castle changed depending what part of the story you were in.  There is none of this in Breath.  And sometimes it rains.  And when it rains you cannot climb.  You cannot build a fire.  You cannot cook.  You cannot transport a blue flame over miles to obtain .... the ability to take photos.  From a tiny, annoying, large-headed female scientist who makes you say \"snap!\".I find myself enjoying aspects - the ability to get through places more than one way, for one.  Creativity in this game is very rewarding, for its own sake.  I no longer feel a sense of wonder about secrets or shrines.  My eyes have glazed over.  Everything is all the same.  But getting around this world and just taking it in almost redeems the bad voice acting, the time-consuming cooking, the lack of memorable music.  Almost.",

The open-world is big and is empty and it's unnecessary it comes off like it's trying to waste your time, and good luck finding your first Village or knowing where to go, and speaking of wasting your time the shrines will waste your time, I don't want to talk about them that's how bad it is, and the temples, what temples?, there's four of them and it doesn't last long at all there's no real challenge to them, the Graphics are beautiful but sometimes I wonder if they play this game for the graphics that's not enough for me, overall this game was designed to waste your time, and piss you off like it did me. Nintendo if you want to make a action RPG because,(I don't consider the Zelda series to be an RPG I considered it to be an action adventure), then make it into an action RPG, there are better open world games that had did it better than this game. You know I used to hate wind Waker for years, but now I love and respect wind Waker it's more Zelda than this game.",

    "review Text": "I can only describe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (BOTW) with superlatives:1. Some of the best graphics I have ever seen in a video game, and the attention to detail is staggering.  As Link runs across a flooded wetland and watch his footsteps leave little rings in the water.  When equipped with greaves, you'll hear them clink and rustle as we'd expect them to.  Sunsets, night skies, misty mornings, lightning storms---the best of nature's palette is skillfully rendered with a master's eye.2. Audio is equally impressive, with scores of original music composed purely for this game and worthy of good headphones or a decent sound system.3. Fun?  Is this game FUN?  Fun doesn't begin to describe BOTW.  Imagine the coolest anime movie ever, a cross between Terminator, The Hobbit, and Excalibur.  Now, imagine that you can enter this movie and walk around in it, examining every nook and crevice from any possible camera angle.  That would be pretty cool, but wait, you're the star of this movie and can interact with just about anything on the set.  Zelda becomes a fully believable alternate reality that you cannot get enough of.Some general info:1. This should be called The Adventures of Link, as Zelda is only glimpsed in flashbacks and briefly in the flesh at the very end of the game.2. This is a very long game--I spent over a month, averaging 3-5 hours a day--and I loved every minute of it.3. Seems like too many controls at first--a bit overwhelming--but the game introduces you to them slowly and logically.4. This is an extremely well thought-out game; everything hangs together and I experienced zero glitches in all my play. It is worth every penny and I would love to see a documentary about HOW they made BOTW.  It's beautiful, it's scope is staggering, and the story is intriguing.  If variety is the spice of life, Zelda is a massive supper with endless courses: play hide-and-seek with a village urchin? Check.  Scale a cliff in subzero winds while trying to locate a hidden shrine? Check.  Shoot monsters with bomb arrows at full gallop on your favorite steed?  Yep, that's on the menu.  Want to fight ancient robots gone rogue that shoot laser beams from their single eye? You've come to the right place, my friend.5. You'll spend much of the first part of the game trying to find a decent shirt!  You'll need to learn how to gather food and cook it, and of course arm yourself with progressively more impressive weapons.  Most games have you scurrying for gold coins or gems, but you'll trade all your wealth for a warm shirt at the beginning.",

    "review Text": "I haven't played a Zelda game since the Super NES Link to the Past, but I STILL go back and play that one on my laptop emulator once every so many years because it is so much fun. This game is NOTHING like the Zelda I grew up with, and not in a good way. I'm about 30 hours in, I'd say.PROS: good graphics overall, except a bit cheesy cartoon graphics in cutscenes (there are a lot, so yeah). Open world, many places to explore. Cute music at times. Fast travel places to warp to. Can tame horses. That's literally it for the pros.CONS:1. TEDIUM: By far the main reason I'll never replay this game and may not bother to finish. The \"open-world\" is just so empty and lacking content that the vast majority of the game, you'll be running around looking for shrines and towers (which you must discover to fast travel to places, forcing you into a neverending hunt for towers and shrines the ENTIRE GAME). We're talking like 80% of the game will be spent doing this. Just running around. And there are A LOT of obstacles that keep you from going direct routes, so good luck with that (climbing, paragliding, walking, running, etc. are most of what you'll do). And randomly getting killed by lightning strikes in rainy areas, which is so much fun...not. Also, if you're expecting lots of fun villages to visit and recharge in (and buy new things in), you will be very disappointed. In a HUGE open world with 10+ regions, there are like 5 villages. I've found 4 through looking online and seeking them out (they're extremely difficult to find on your own in such a massive empty game world).2. WEAPONS: break all the time, and make you have to consider whether it's worth it to kill a low level enemy with a good weapon since it'll break and all you can do is find another via killing enemies and shrines. But another frustrating thing about the weapons breaking is (1) you can't repair them, (2) you have to use them on puzzles in shrines all the time, so you'll break a bunch of weapons just solving puzzles, and (3) YOU CAN\"T BUY WEAPONS! Seriously, who thought this was a good idea to deny the player the opportunity to buy their own weapons from sellers when they constantly break? Bad game design.3. NON-LINEAR PLAY: I recall A Link to the Past having a set path you must travel to progress, and it made perfect sense because you weren't ready to take on the big boss without the right gear, skills, and heart buildup. Not so much here, where you run around and defeat low-level enemies all the time, but then suddenly face a higher level larger enemy out of the blue somewhere and die immediately because you don't have anywhere near enough hearts or a nice enough weapon to take them on. Too bad! The non-linear format is super annoying because you don't know where to go first and why. The main plot is loosely structured. I do not like non-linear unless there's more to the game--we don't have that with Zelda, because there is just so much emptiness. I've played Dragon Age: Inquisition and what made that almost open-world work well was the array of different points of interest to explore. No dice here--just shrines, towers, enemies randomly scattered, and a very rare village.4. SHRINES: There are so many you'll hate completing them by the 20th or so (I hear there are 120). They're puzzles you have to solve with your special abilities (and the reward is a spirit orb, which is basically 1/4 of a heart or stamina bump). And they are TEDIOUS and several are downright difficult to figure out--a little more advanced than I'm interested in as a casual player. I use walkthroughs frequently, and you will too, because you'll be so tired of having to sit and figure them out on your own after the umpteenth shrine that slows down your momentum. And what's sad is there's no great payoff for the shrines except a fast travel point, the spirit orb, and maybe an occasional bit of amber to sell for rupees or an occasional weapon that will break quickly.5. FOOD/POTIONS: You don't just get to buy heart potions and magic potions like the old days---nope. You buy ingredients to make food to make potions to recover hearts/stamina. Yippee. And the only places you can make food are in cauldrons, which are few and far between in this version of Hyrule. Hence the need for constant fast travel back and forth between villages and wherever you're trying to explore or get to. Yet another tedious activity of having to constantly make food after battles or travel.6. CHARACTERS: No joke, all the women you can talk to in this entire game sound like Japanese porn stars. They giggle, they coo, and they make weird sexual sounds. The great fairy who allows you to upgrade your armor with special ingredients sounds like she's having TOO good of a time, if you know what I mean. This is bizarre and completely inappropriate, frankly.7. REWARDS/PAYOFF: Spending hours on a side quest might get you 20 rupees (I just finished a quest where this happened). Or a thank you and nothing. Completing shrines gets you very little. Beating tough enemies/bosses gives you very little (maybe a weapon that will last one enemy and some mechanical parts worth a few rupees). Opening chests that you had to kill several enemies to unlock (yes, this is how this game works) might give you a piece of amber (worth like 50 rupees), or a crappy weapon. I started to wonder why they structured the game in such an unrewarding way. Why offer so little reward for side quests and beating enemies and opening chests in the game?As I said, the majority of this game, you will be running around the wide open space desperately looking for a shrine to fast travel to, the tower to fast travel to, and the towns to buy things in. The hype is very confusing to me, because the SNES Zelda was leaps and bounds better than this but critics LOVE this game. I don't get it.It's a massive game.....but ultimately a massive bore.",

    "review Text": "The game design is very nice, graphics, scenery and all that. This could have been GOAT Zelda game, but it's just lacking and repetitive. I won't point out all the greta things because there's thousands of rave reviews, just gonna share my thoughts on how it could have been better.1. First of all, the game lacks enemy variety. You mostly see the same 3 enemy types throughout the land. I'm talking like 90% of the time it's either a pig creature, a lizard creature, or a tall aardvark looking thing. In addition to those, you will find other enemies, sure...Like you'll see a Lynel every once in a while. Or when near water, a creature that spits rocks at You. Or like maybe in certain areas these samurai enemies appear. But these are few and far between. I just wish the 90% would be more varied, it just gets too repetitive imo.2. The game has been stripped of it's dungeons. They replaced it with 4 huge mechanical animals which you enter inside and solve it puzzle to then fight a version of Calamity Ganon. These 4 areas are fun, no doubt, but they lack enemies, and they lack a unique boss. I just wish there was more of them, maybe 8 or 10 of these? And I don't know, maybe have a unique boss in there? Why are we fighting various Ganon types, this just seems lazy to me.3. The final dungeon (or castle actually) is very impressive...visually. But, it's lacking. First, it's just too damn easy!...And it's practically empty. And when you do come across some enemies, guess what, it's the same tall aardvarks i mentioned above. The final boss, Calamity Ganon, is impressive, but like we just seen him 4 times in various forms already, so there's no big reveal here. It's like, oh well there he is again :(4. Too many shrines! There's like 100 of them, enough already! Reminds me of rice in a burrito, just filler. So ya it's kind of fun to find these shrines, which some are hidden, and ya some have cool puzzles to solve, but cmon already. It's just overkill bro. Less shrines, more dungeons please.4. Weapons breaking = annoying. The weapons just keep breaking after a few uses. Like why? Can't it just go dull and maybe you can to a shop and have it strengthened or sharpened? Why does it have to break? It just adds annoyance to the game, not challenge. They really need to cut this sh*t out of the game.5. Music? what music? There's nothing to see here. The sounds you hear are more atmospheric. Like something you put on when you go to bed almost. It fits the game in areas, but why not have a few memorable tunes in key points of the game?. Don't expect a soundtrack you'd want to download and play like SOTN or like FF7 or whatever.If they just improved on the game in these area, it would probably be one of the greatest games every made.",

As a sandbox rpg, it doesnt do anything really new in the genre. What it does,it does competently, but you have seen this all before if you've played a lot of these types of games. And as far as a Zelda game, it lacks a whole lot of the personality I associate with the other entries in the series. the story isnt as well emphasized it seems. And the biggest aspects that fans associate with Zelda games are missing - the dungeon puzzles are not particularly challenging in the least (mostly just physics puzzles instead of the traditional puzzles from the series) and the bosses arent quite as nuanced either. It just lacks a lot of what makes a zelda game truly a zelda game. And I'd you're reading reviews, you already know that the weapon breaking system is far more annoying than it needs to be. It just seems like a weak mechanic to throw on to capture the survival game genres current popularity.In summation, solid game worth playing, especially if you're new to sandbox genre or the zelda series, but likely not great for veterans of either.",

In most other games you may see mountains in the background but they're decorations, scenery on each side against the path you're restricted to. In this game you can GO to the mountains, climb them and explore the valleys between them.  Deep forests, vast desert, tropical beaches, horse-plains, canyon lands and a rather unnerving volcanic region (so hot you burst into flames without the proper protection), it's just gigantic. Throughout this land are puzzle shrines to solve, minor side quests, four major quests and the final battle -  and lots of villages, people to meet, horses to ride, food to hunt for and meals to cook, and much much more.If you're a gamer who's main interest is just defeating the bosses and winning the final battle then this game may be wasted on you. If you're an explorer and scenery junkie who can't pass by a hill without wondering the view is like on top then prepare to set aside a significant chunk of your life.  Me, I  circled around the entire continent, gradually closing in on the castle in the center where the final battle takes place. By the time I reached it I had run out of places to visit, having explored every square foot of this huge land to the best I could. It took me three months including many nights exploring until 3am, so the final battle was a bittersweet culmination representing the end of a truly great gaming experience.",

    "review Text": "Great launch game with the Switch hardware.  It put limitations into perspective and due to the amount of game-play it got me to use the game portable, docked, and even kick stand mode once or twice.It was a fine game, up there with other open world adventures.  I enjoyed the boss fights and dungeons quite a bit.  Sometimes it was nice to have so many little things to do when I didn't feel like following the adventure.  I ultimately finished at 45 hours and while I didn't get everything, I feel I got a good amount of enjoyment out of it before it started feeling like too much of a chore. I did get all the story related scenes and did enjoy those.I almost chose to give it 4 stars instead of 3 because I'm scared of how angry the supporters of this game are.  But it had flaws.  And one of them were especially disappointing for a brand new piece of hardware --The frame-rate drops are not excusable. Certain areas are painfully sluggish.-The weapon breaking and temporary buff nature of this game are very odd features for such a long game. Though the ability to cook and create things is pretty nice, it's unfortunate that so much effort can lead to just 3 minutes of benefit. You can't repair or modify weapons to make them better really and the fact they break in 3-4 combos for the most part is pretty painful.  All enemies drop weapons you can use to defeat them but it really makes being rewarded a special sword or something seem very pointless...-The dungeons were easily my favorite part of the game, but there are so few and while fun, they're very short. Most of the game has this quantity over quality feel to it, with so many generic shrines (aesthetically at least, the actual puzzles were almost always different, some more creative than others. But they kind of blur together eventually) and those seeds... but the dungeons are the opposite.  So few and very high quality feeling.-The weather really hurt the pacing sometimes.-Voice acting.  Just because this is the first Zelda game with serious voice acting that isn't an excuse for putting such little effort into it when the rest of the industry is doing pretty excellent.-Most of the side quests/upgrades are just fetch quests.  Eventually nothing was very difficult... you just had to have patience.  And that's fine for a few hours, but when you have to wait through weeks of in-game days (even with a fire) to farm scales it's unnecessary and not fun.-My biggest pain point was that ultimately this didn't feel like much of a Zelda game.  It felt closer to open world Ubisoft games where there is a serious quantity over quality issue related to the number of map points, items to collect, and places to go but a lack of relevance as to 'why' and little effort to mix up.-Since this game really nailed that 'true open world' experience there was no story progression. Only a beginning, end and a few non-sequential story points scattered throughout the middle (dungeons).  The memories were more world building.",

    "review Text": "Been playing LOZ since before adventure of link was around.  This game is trash.  The open world is good.  The exploration is good.  But it has the completely unforgivable sin of scripted battles and puzzles that require getting answers online.Example of this would that in many places there are boxes that shoot lasers.  In exactly one place they appear it can be picked up and moved.  Only one time in the whole game is this even possible and that is the only solution for this puzzle.Or boss battles.  Boss appears.  Boss is invincible to all but a certain strategy.  I did the four main dungeons and considered three to be worthless due to the nature of the puzzles.  Only the wind shrine dungeon had puzzles that actually felt designed to reward the player.  The rest were frustration.  Things like you should know that you have to freeze a waterfall to proceed, except you have never been able to freeze a waterfall before this and you never can after this.The game doesn't do anything to explain the mechanics of anything.

The fact that you can tackle any one of these things at your own pace and almost never get pulled to the main path is liberating, but the way all of Breath of the Wild’s systems fit elegantly into complex light survival game is even more impressive.

    "review Text": "It's a good game with massive flaws and a beautiful world.The freedom that climbing gives you is definitely unmatched, and it makes for some interesting gameplay. Combining various elements of the game's \"nature\" system (temperature, mass/momentum, etc.) can provide likewise innovative play and problem solving experiences. And just hearing the crunch of the grass under your boots and the crickets chirping around you goes a long way to immersing you in a believable, beautiful world.But that is really the primary plus of this game. Most everything else is mediocre to bad. The combat is, largely, terrible. You will usually just be shooting an arrow into something or pressing a button a few times to whack it with one of your constantly-breaking weapons. There's very little to nothing in the way of interesting moves/combos or even enemy behavior. Yes, you can make use of the tools/physics system to do some pretty crazy things, but you will never be doing these things in normal play. All of those videos you see online of someone doing something crazy with multiple tools and items probably spent a long time racking their brain just to figure it out, and it will never be as efficient as just whacking whatever's bothering you or shooting it in the face. Most enemies fit the same mold as one another, with slight variations here and there, because they have to be able to hold one of the handful of weapon types that the game offers in case you need them. A lot of the interesting monsters from Zelda history are missing, and we're instead left mostly fighting chameleon men and a few variations on the pig-orc man. The miniboss mobs like Lynels do offer some more challenge, but are still very repetitive and are usually not worth the hassle. Funnily, Lynels are also far more difficult/interesting to fight than the actual bosses that the game offers, which are all very similar in their visual design and can be beaten extremely easily if you have the right gear.The dungeons are likewise disappointing. The shrines are often short and forgettable, and the Divine Beasts aren't much different. Changing the orientation of their body-parts in order to solve puzzles and access items sounds interesting, but it isn't used to much effect.The towns in the game are ok, but often feel stiff/hollow. A handful of buildings/people make something like Goron City feel more like a base camp. Zora's Domain is much more spectacular, but also feels kind of dead and lifeless with the dozen or so inhabitants all standing about doing very little. It is one in a long list of examples of things in this game that feel outdated. The things that can make some of the towns like Kakariko or Hateno more enjoyable are the music and visual design, which is often extremely high quality. The day/night musical tracks for Hateno are some of the best I've ever heard in a game. It's a shame that there isn't more of this wonderful music throughout the game, which mostly chooses to go for short flourishes in the overworld and one particular track for each town, or some very forgettable, manic tracks during combat. The pulled-back music is actually a good choice. It serves to immerse the player more in the world, and what little chimes/flourishes are there actually do have an effect. I just wish there was more actual music sprinkled around.BotW is a game that is defined by its freedom, for good and bad. The freedom that allows you to immediately fight the final boss and beat the game is the same \"freedom\" that means all of the dungeons are going to be samey/mediocre. The freedom that allows you to go anywhere at any time is the same \"freedom\" that means you will essentially have one toolset for the entire game with very little, if any, growth. The freedom that allows you to uncover the story in various bits in any order is the same \"freedom\" that means that the story will be terribly bland and have virtually no plot.I would sum this game up in much the same way that I would sum up a game like MGSV or Skyrim:It's a good game, but a poor iteration of its series. It offers some extremely strong elements and many hours of fun play, but also stumbles pretty hard on certain things which are very much core elements of Zelda's identity. BotW is a good game, but a bad Zelda game.",

(D) Don't want to wait to get the Master Sword Until you solve those countless  puzzles in countless Shrines,  (E) Don't like fighting with weak weapons which are only temporary. A Pickup and go sort of thing.THEN, even though you maybe dazzled by the gigantic size and realism of the world.  You maybe a bit let down in the actual game play.I had more fun interaction with Paya and the King/Old man  than the rest of the characters in the game.The last thing is size. While bigger would seem better, but it comes at the high cost of Your time. Travelling so far with a not so willing horse consumes still a HUGE AMOUNT OF TIME. We're talking hours upon hours of game play. And guess that's ok if you got though.My solution: Simple. Never try to beat the game. Just create a new unlinked account every time I play the game. That way the difficulty is not increased every time you replay the game. You get the paraglider and just play around/mountain climb for a while just exploring the huge world. NOW it works great for that for me.  Sure I'm a Zelda fan and played Ocarina of Time and Link to the Past, but do I really want to go through what BOTW is asking for in time/distance to \"beat the game\"? No way.  It would've been different if you were rewarded with lots of interaction with Zelda herself. But just a bunch of cutscenes? Only? I think not.",

The weapons as others have said are very fragile most of the time.  SO YOU HAVE TO USE STRATEGY.  THIS GAME IS NOT VERY EVERYBODY. I WOULD RENT IT BEFORE BUYING. The DLC adds so much more content and hours of game play. You have to put in the time if you are going to beat and enjoy this game🙂.6/13/21 -When I first started playing this game, it started slow.  Then it started picking up.My first encounter with frustration and anger happened when I started doing side quests and The Divine Beasts.  I’d highly recommend leveling up and obtaining more equipment. YOU WILL NEED IT definitely for defeating The Divine Beasts.As an example, the elephant divine beast will be much easier if you have the upgraded stasis rune.This game WILL NOT hold your hand. Yes you will get help in game from NPC’s and other sources but YOU will work and earn everything you get in this game.This game for me is deliberately designed to make you THINK and CHALLENGE YOURSELF.You play at your own pace.  You can hunt. You can cook.  You can be barbaric.  You can terrorize animals if you want.  You can be nice and helpful if you want.  There is no time limit here except in mini games as far as I know.This is a game where exploring really will be a rewarding experience.  It will be a great idea to not follow the story plot and play Breath Of Wild your way.The only other games that I can compare with Breath Of Wild is those three newest Tomb Raider games.On the Nintendo Switch Console this game looks amazing. On the highest elevations you can see in every direction. On a big screen like a 75�?TV it will look spectacular.I’d love to have the ability to fly in this game at will whenever I want and never have to worry about the stamina running out.Something else about this game for me is I feel like I am in the game.

While Ocarina of Time started my love of the series, I looked forward to each new iteration to see how the items, puzzle-solving, and combat would satisfy my need to visit Hyrule. Consequently, while Breath of the Wild snuck under the radar for me (in part because I didn’t own the consoles it released on at the time), I almost have trouble going back and playing the older Zelda titles because of its mold-breaking success. Needless to say, this game was what impelled me to finally buy a Switch a few years ago.I could continue to sing the praises of this game heaped upon it by other reviewers. But, instead, I’ll point out that it’s a game I’ll still occasionally pull out and play, even when I have newer titles that I haven’t even played yet. Part of this is because, while I did eventually beat the game (at my own pace and on my own terms), I still have bits of the DLC to accomplish that challenge my skills. Plus, the VR mode with the Nintendo Labo add-on is a neat addition, and I found myself more fully immersed when I played that way.As Breath of the Wild was my first introduction to games that were more “open-world�?than the standard linear Zelda format, I’ve found that I enjoy this genre and have even jumped into games like Shadow of the Colossus and The Witcher 3 as a result. The fact that I want to start a new game of Breath of the Wild to experience all the little things all over again speaks volumes of its greatness. Granted, it’s not entirely perfect, with some mechanics and content feeling flawed or lacking, but I can’t wait to see what the sequel has in store as a result.The mold-breaking, definitive Zelda experience, I give The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 4.5 stars out of 5.",

    "review Text": "After playing this game for 20-30 hours, I wrote this Amazon review and gave the game two stars, partly out of frustration.  Now that I've completed the game, I feel it only fair to come back and give it a couple more stars and update the review:Most descriptions say that this Zelda game is nothing like the ones that came before it.  That's not really true.  I've played every Zelda game from the very first one through Twilight Princess and this one's not that different.  Yes, the world of Hyrule in this game is a LOT bigger than previous games, and once you learn the ropes you can pretty much go exploring wherever you want...although that's part of the problem - if you wander into an area that's too advanced for the level Link is currently at, you'll die quickly and frustratingly.  But beyond the size and openness of the world, this is a fairly standard Zelda game.For example: you start in a restricted area until you learn the controls.  There's an old man at the beginning who acts as your guide (and later in the game there are various voices and characters that give you hints).  You start out having to find four mini-dungeon \"shrines\" and solve their puzzles to gain tools/skills that will help you across the whole game.  When that's done you get access to the wider world.  You then have to find four \"divine beasts\" that are really just bigger, more complicated dungeon/puzzles and solve them.  There are hidden shrines all over the game where you can win orbs that are the equivalent of pieces of heart - once you have four you can trade them in for an extra heart container (more life) or extended endurance (run/swim/climb further) (hint: the endurance is important early in the game so you can climb to high, otherwise inaccessible areas, the hearts are helpful later as the enemies get tougher).  Eventually you win the game by finding and beating Ganon.  Technically I think you can beat Ganon without doing a lot of the above stuff, but the whole point of the game is to wander around collecting the hearts, skills, weapons, armor and allies that will make beating Ganon easier.  There are a ton of hidden things and pointless side quests and whatnot, but that's the main gist of the game.  Very similar to previous Zelda games.So what's not to like?  Unfortunately, a good bit:- The control layout is terrible.  To crouch, you push in on the joystick that controls which direction Link runs.  So I was constantly getting killed by enemies because I'd be trying to run or dodge and accidentally crouch down and let them hit me instead.  To zoom the camera in, you push in on the joystick that controls the camera.  I'd be trying to turn the camera around to look at an enemy behind me and suddenly I'm zoomed in to a level where I couldn't even tell what I was looking at and boom...I'm dead.  Again.  I'd try to lock onto a target and accidentally pull out a bomb or the magnet instead.  Later in the game, I kept wasting Daruk's protection because it's the same button as locking onto a target.  The motion-sensitive controller made it hard to aim arrows correctly.  The battles in this game are hard enough without having to constantly fight the controller too.- Speaking of those hard battles: many of the bosses in this game are ridiculous.  Even the \"easier\" ones are harder than the final fight against Gannon was in Ocarina of Time.  God help you if you can't master doing a backflip at exactly the right nanosecond to trigger the frenzy attack mode.  Or do the perfect guard move that deflects opponent's attacks back at them.  It took me THREE DAYS to beat Thunderblight Ganon (partially because I didn't realize the desert area was one of the hardest parts of the game and attempted it too soon).  I swear if I heard that \"helpful\" voice say \"This thing is fast...this thing is powerful\" one more time I would have thrown the Switch out a window.  And even when I did finally beat him, the fight ended up breaking most of my best weapons, a couple shields and using up all my electricity defending food.- Which bring us to those breaking weapons...man is that annoying.  A really nice sword should last for a while, not break after you kill a couple goblins with it.  And they always break in the middle of a fight when you need them most, and if you don't notice it's gone you have no idea why your attacks are suddenly doing no damage.  A high quality bow breaks after firing a dozen or so arrows - I'd be taking that bow back to the store for a refund.  You spend three quarters of the game trying to scavenge for better weapons.  And then when you do stumble across really nice ones, you don't want to use them because they'll break right away.  Really stupid addition to the Zelda series.- The whole concept of cooking food to regain health makes sense on the surface, but the fact that you can pause the game in the middle of a fight to have a snack is just dumb.  What's your opponent doing?  \"Oh, he called time out, so I'll just stand here and watch him eat until he comes back and kicks my butt.\"  And while I'm not a vegetarian, I could easily see people being put off by the fact that you can kill wild animals (even wolves!) which then turn instantly into raw meat you can cook and eat.  Kind of...icky.  You don't have to do it, but it's one of the easiest ways to regain a lot of health.  But spending hours of game time trying to pick out the right ingredients to cook up heart-replenishing food items is...not fun.  But I guess it makes more sense than running around cutting down grass and smashing vases in the hope of finding hidden hearts.- As others have pointed out, yes the world is huge and there are a ton of side quests and mini-puzzles and hard-to-kill monsters and shrines hidden all over the place, but you spend a good portion of your time just wandering around not knowing what you're supposed to do next.  And doing web search after web search to try to get a hint of what's expected of you robs the game of a lot of fun.- The weather sucks in this game.  Just flat out sucks.  It seems like it's constantly raining and/or dark out, so while you have this huge world to explore, most of the time you can't see much of it.  Every time it rains, you can't climb,  so you end up standing around waiting for the rain to end.  If a thunderstorm erupts you'll probably get killed by lightning again and again until you figure out that you need to unequip any metallic weapons, bows or shields.  And even then you might get hit by a random bolt.  What's the point of the rain and lightning, other than annoying the player?On the positive side:- It's hilarious to climb up somewhere high and just keep raining bombs down on enemies (you have an unlimited number of bombs in this game, so this strategy is a good one to use when possible).  Often they'll see the bomb land near them and run over with a quizzical expression to figure out what it is and...BOOM, they're sailing through the air, taking big damage.  Maybe I'm just a sick SOB, but that made me laugh every time.  Plus it's an easy (although time consuming) way to get past a few of the more difficult enemies you find out in the open areas.- I guess the graphics are pretty nice?  From the praise other reviews have given them, I was expecting something amazing, but...eh, they're OK.  Parts of the world of Hyrule are beautiful in this game, while other parts are eyesores.  The final battle with Ganon looks amazing (he's downright terrifying - I'm a 53 year old man, and I might have nightmares about it), even if the battle itself is a bit of an anticlimax.All in all, while there were things about this game that made it the most annoying Zelda title since Majora's Mask, I'm glad I played it through to the end.  I'm half tempted to start a new game.  I'll miss exploring that massive version of Hyrule.  Final advice: if you get stuck somewhere or can't figure out how to get into a particular area, just move on and explore somewhere else.  There are plenty of clues and helpful characters scattered across the world, but the world is so huge you probably just haven't found them yet.  Expect to spend dozens, if not hundreds of hours on this game - it's not quick or easy to finish.",

I later moved on the Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, Wii and Wii U. The only time I got a system that wasn't a Nintendo system was in college when I got a Playstation 2. One of my favorite series from Nintendo is The Legend of Zelda. The game lives and dies off of a standard formula: find expansive dungeons, solve the puzzles in these dungeons, grab the treasure and find the next dungeon. Do this 6-8 times and then fight Ganon.Breath of the Wild takes that formula and turns it upside down. The world is your oyster and you can go wherever you want, whenever you want. There is no order to the game. In fact, if you want to go fight Ganon with nothing more than a stick, go for it. Hyrule is a vast, beautiful world full of danger, wildlife, interesting villages and much more.However, watch out. Link has never been more vulnerable. Many enemies can take you out in one swipe. A thunderstorm could strike you down. Weapons become brittle with usage and you might lose a sword at the wrong time. Combat and battle is beyond button mashing. You must think carefully about things and be cautious with the steps you take.The game is loaded with side quests, shrines, which act as mini dungeons with puzzles to solve and treasures to obtain. You could spend at least 50 hours just exploring everything.This is not only the best Zelda game I've ever played, but maybe the best game ever.",

When the game advances the hits become mote like reality and I’ve spent more time dying in this game than advancing in the story line.

    "review Text": "I seldom write reviews or rate anything 5 stars, so believe me when I'm rating this game ***** it's because it exceeded my expectations by leaps and bounds.I have never been a Nintendo person, and never played any Zelda game before this one. My gaming experience before switch has been on PS3, PS4 Pro and Xbox One S, and I always thought Sony delivered the best AAA games. To this day I would say The Last of Us has the best story line among all the video games I every played. The only reason I bought Xbox One S was to play backward compatible games like Red Dead Redemption, GTA IV etc. and I never cared about the Xbox exclusives. Whenever I used to walk across a Nintendo console in a store it always gave off a vibe that it was made for kids(no offence meant!). As an adult, there was no Nintendo title that excited me. Despite the lack of enthusiasm I did buy a 3DS once and I did enjoy Super Mario 3D Land but I desperately missed the lack of a story line. So once I beat the game I got rid of the console despite it giving me an opportunity for on-the-go gaming.Cut to the launch of Nintendo Switch. I was still not excited by the prospect of this new under-powered, though portable console with price higher than consoles like PS4 and XB1(S) that would absolutely thump Switch in all benchmarks. So I held back. A couple of months ago I visited a friend who owns a Switch and I got to try Mario Kart and a couple of other games. I was seriously impressed by how fun it made gaming with the 2 Joy Cons turning into a couple of controllers to play together. So I made up my mind to get one, but the prospect of buying it only to play Mario Kart was not exciting. So I researched for the best game that a Nintendo Noob could get into and bought this one with my spanking brand new Red and Blue Switch.I was no idea what I was getting into when I fired up this game for the first time at 9PM at night on Friday evening. I thought I would try it for an hour or so and if I didn't like it I would eat the loss on the game but return the console. Fast forward to 5AM on Saturday morning I was paragliding from one mountain peak to another searching for Shrines to collect those much needed Spirit Orbs. I was HOOKED! The game play, art design, story in this game is absolutely mind blowing. When I later read somewhere that this was Nintendo's first foray into open world gaming with Zelda I just could not believe it! How the hell did they manage to deliver such a knockout hit, and probably the best open world game I have played so far with no prior expertise? Even other excellent open world games like GTA V, Witcher 3 and Horizon Zero Dawn pale in comparison to BOTW. I have played this for over 60 hours now but I have tackled only one divine beast yet and managed to get the Master Sword just yesterday. There is so much to see, to do, to fight and to collect in this game that I easily see me spending over 300hrs on it. $1 for 5 hours of the best gaming experience that's available to us today makes this a fantastic deal to me.As for the cons, the only gripe I have is that some of the animations become too tiring after a while - the Sheikah tower activation, the shrine activation, spirit orb delivery. I just wish there was a way to disable them.So if you are on the fence about this game, just go for it!",

    "review Text": "As a longtime fan of the series I can't help but feel as though something was lost in translation with Breath of the Wild. Gone are the handcrafted dungeons and boss fights. Gone is the charming narrative.My biggest issues with Breath of the Wild are the weapon fragility and it's narrative. It was marketed on player freedom, yet it contradicts this by breaking weapons you enjoy using in an attempt to force you to experiment. If you have to 'force' a player to experiment, that's bad game design. New things should be compelling enough on their own to cause the player to experiment on their own. This system also undermined any sense of discovery that would have otherwise came from opening a treasure chest. It also causes you to horde weapons and ultimately avoiding combat all together.More traditional dungeons have been replaced with 150 shrines and 4 divine beasts. The problem is that the shrines end up becoming repetitive, while the divine beasts are utterly forgettable. These end up feeling a bit like they were copy/pasted throughout the world. This extends to the boss battles as well where it's hard to distinguish between the various incarnations of Ganon.In terms of it's narrative the game is a step back from the likes of Skyward Sword, Twilight Princess and Windwaker. Part of the problem is that the game is set 100 years after Hyrule fell to ruin. There are no real stakes in the game. I couldn't help feeling like I would rather have been playing during the events of 100 years past. They really want us to care about the champions but none of them get enough screen time to where you feel you have a good sense of their character. Not like Midna in Twilight Princess.Perhaps even more insulting is the inclusion of 999 korok seeds. This is the kind of stuff you would expect in an Ubisoft open world game. Not something from Nintendo. There is a lot of quantity but not all of it is 'quality'.If your going into this game expecting an engaging story like we had with Twilight Princess? You won't get that here. By all means, try it. You may enjoy the game, unfortunately I was left feeling a bit...underwhelmed.",

    "review Text": "As a gamer who has grown up along with the Zelda franchise (dating back to the original NES Legend of Zelda) I can vouch for this being the best Zelda yet.  As a parent with a young child it can be very challenging to find meaningful time to play video games.  The combination of the Switch's portability and how easy it is to jump in to this game and accomplish something meaningful in a short amount of time is a game changer.  If you have ten minutes to spare or ten hours you can still do something productive.Some reviewers have complained about weapons and shields constantly breaking, but I believe these people haven't actually spent much time playing the game.  Yes, technically this does happen but the game provides more than enough replacements that I haven't found it to be an issue.  After 60+ hours of play, not once have I been left with no shield or weapon, and rarely have I been left with all under-powered weapons.My advice to those who plan to play the game but have not yet, spend 20 or so minutes on the internet researching beginner tips for this game and your experience will be greatly enhanced from the start.  This game does not hold your hand the way every Zelda game has in the past.  The story line is unique to every instance of this game (not even every person), and the world is as challenging, engaging and complex as you are willing to make it.If you are searching for a game that you can beat in 20 hours or less you need to look elsewhere.  If you are searching for a game that will keep you busy for countless hours with nearly infinite replay-ability there is no need to look any further.Pros:-A new Zelda game!-Massive open world-Easy to accomplish something productive in a short amount of time-Many ways to solve each puzzle-Currently two DLC's if you want even more contentCons:-Lost sleep",

I feared that this game was not going to satisfy me like its predecessors.  When I got the game and about half way through it I realized something...I realized that this is not a Zelda game. That this not the same game that I fell in love with throughout the years.They took out all the things that make a Zelda game great. All the characteristics of a Zelda game.such as giving you all the of your gadgets right up front. In the past I loved it when you came up to a rocky ledge and realized you had to wait and get the hook-shot to get up there, which you had to wait until the 3rd dungeon to get! You didn't appreciate your weapons as much in this game because you didn't work hard to get them. I remember in Majoras Mask and Ocarina you had to do various quests to get the most powerful swords in the game and that that gave you a sense of pride once you obtained them. In Breath of the Wild they gave you a plethora of fancy looking weapons....that brake! Too much is not always a good thing.One of the other things that got to me was the side quests in the game. The rewards are crap! There are so many quest that sound fun but give you mainly rupees or other items you can just sell for more rupees. Why do the side quests when you can just seek out ore deposits that deliver more goods? Where's the heart pieces that give you an urgency to find and collect them?? The best items in the game you can just get from shrines or mini bosses.And how 'bout those shrines? They were fun for a little while and then it just gets repetitive. Just when I feel like I'm doing something new it reveals another shrine. It seamed like everything revolved around  these shrines. Where are all the Temples and dungeons that take an hour or two to complete which give you another sense of pride? Or the cool gadgets that help you to finish the dungeon and defeat the dungeon boss? And now that you have that  gadget you can go get some more heart pieces you saw earlier... There's only 4 dungeons that take 15 maybe 20 minutes to complete. The bosses weren't half bad. The Ganon boss was okay.The story... You went around finding memories that slowly gave you details to a predictable ending. I did connect to Zelda's struggles though.Some minor problems with the game are that they got rid of cutting grass to get items, hearts, rupees etc. Bottles.I think the freedom of the game was not a good thing. In this game you don't earn freedom, but you were given freedom. Which ruined it for me.I feel like the creators sacrificed quality over quantity. I give this game a 7. And as a portable game alone, I give it an 8.5.I fear that because this  game got high ratings that Nintendo will keep up this Zelda trend. I hope i'm wrong.",

The main story line quests were fun and interesting, but the way you get to them takes FOREVER. The weapon durability system is terrible and even hardcore fans agree on that to some extent, yet here we are. You also need to buy armor and elixars just to continue the game meaning you have to grind for money. The horse in the game is really clunky for an open world game.In short this is a decent game, but also an extremely high rated game with a few major flaws.

Take it from me, I'm 34 and rarely ever play video games anymore due to a shorter attention span as an adult.  I also never played any of the Zelda games as a kid.  Yet despite all this , BotW still absolutely captivated and hooked me.As I type this, I'm no where near \"finishing\" this game.  I've put in about 50 hours, and it has kinda taken over my life...  so you've been warned.  The length and quality of this game is well worth $300 for buying an entire console for it.  (Update: I've now played over 125 hours and I'm still in no rush to finish it).The beauty of this game is that it's an open-world, free-choice game, yet it still has a story line and there are objectives in place in order to progress through the story...  You just aren't under any pressure to actually do them, nor is there a strict order in which this can occur.  Imagine it like a tapestry, where everything you do is going to be related to something else that happens later down the road.  No matter HOW you play the game, you will progress through the story, and your objectives will become clearer and easier to attain as you progress in game play and gain experience and resources.No matter what type of game you like to play, BotW delivers.  You can go around fighting as many enemies as possible if you like a lot of combat action.  The pictures I chose to upload are screenshots I took of my absolute favorite enemy in the game, called a Lynel.  They will kick your ***.  If you like puzzles, then go to as many shrines as you can find.  If you like leveling up (like increasing your number of hearts, defense, and making elixirs, collecting stronger and stronger weapons), you can do the tasks required to do so.  If you like to follow story lines and quests, you can complete the objectives required to do so (and make sure you talk to lots of people).  If you just want to run around on a horse and hunt animals, you can even do that, too. You can ride things other than horses, too, but I won't spoil that.  Really, there are all kinds of surprises in the game where you stop and say \"no way, I never thought I could do that!!\"The game physics is amazing and extremely realistic.  Yes, you can crush enemies with large objects.  Yes, if you shoot a rope that holds a lantern, the lantern will fall and crash.  If you have the imagination for it, it's probably possible.Major bonus:  You can save the game at any point, so there's no pressure to reach save points, and there is no risk of losing any of your progress.  WHEW.In my opinion, BotW owes its wild success to being an exceptionally well-rounded, well-designed game.  It really does have something for everyone.  I haven't played many games in my life, but I've definitely never encountered such a non-linear yet story-oriented game.  Thank you, Nintendo.  Been with you since I was 8 years old!",

I'm taking my sweet time and loving every bit of it! There's really no need for a guide, but that isn't to say this game is by any means easy. The most veteran players will find a worthy challenge - I certainly have. You can't drone through anything and be successful - which is something that games like Destiny (or other treasure based RPG's) have molded us to do. With BOTW, there is no room for droning. It's funny, because at the beginning of the game, I distinctly remember WANTING to drone - that was a thought that went through my mind.\"Okay, how do I get the Master Sword and kill Ganon?\"I quickly, but rather unconsciously changed my tune, which was very interesting. I never realized I was primed to think that droning was the norm (from years of other games) and here, I drew new associations & connections because the old ways were no longer useful. This world was too large and too dynamic, to simply be an automaton. It felt like a weight lifted - to be able to freely search and actually explore without being forced to follow some fabricated game-formula.You want to pay attention - you want to discover - nothing is forced, yet nothing is merely given out either. You're first groomed by small, genuine victories (trust me, you'll be working hard to scrape by). But then you learn little tips and tricks along the way and that contributes to the overall success of your journey. Only after paying your dues can you accomplish larger, more intricate tasks; it's analogous to the real world.Lastly, I'll say that there is always something to be explored and rewards to be received (whether a usable treasure or the accomplishment of solving a difficult puzzle). It has been quite some time since I have felt the satisfaction of solving puzzles in video games, with disregard to whatever loot was obtained in the process. And while this massive game is finite, you take away something invaluable that is not finite:Finding new ways to solve problems - which is far more valuable than any virtual reward.",

    "review Text": "I'm a huge fan of open-world games. I loved Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor, I loved Metal Gear V: The Phantom Pain and I loved The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.The durability system kinda sucks, but it didn't ruin the game for me. Having your weapon break after just a few enemies (or a single guardian if your weapon is weak and not durable enough) is no fun and they really should have come up with a better system to get people to swap through weapons; however, the game provides you with a plentiful source of weaponry and it's easy to stock up.The game will start you off with nothing. Literally. No food, no weapons, no clothing and barely any hearts or stamina. You'll complete shrines (with either a Test of Strength that has a single uncorrupted mini-guardian of varying difficulty or some sort of platforming/puzzle element) which is basically this game's temples. There are 120 total shrines after the DLC and completing each one will grant you a Spirit Orb. You need four Spirit Orbs to gain a Heart Container or a Stamina Container at Goddess Statues situated throughout the world. Even with all of the DLC, you will not be able to maximize both your Stamina and your Hearts. You will always be either two hearts short, two stamina bar pieces short or one heart and one stamina bar piece short. You can only maximize one. But that's not a huge deal. I'd kill for a small DLC that added eight more shrines to finish off my total hearts, but it doesn't matter, ultimately.You can have a total of 3 full bars of stamina (I recommend this, as stamina is needed for climbing and gliding long distances) and 30 maximum hearts. Not at the same time. You can also get yellow hearts from eating certain foods after cooking them (hearty foods made from hearty truffles and so on) up to a maximum of 30. So if you have max hearts, hearty truffles are only useful as full-healing items when cooked.But enough about that.The world is one giant map. After you complete the initial loose tutorial on the Great Plateau, you'll earn your wings (or your paraglider, rather) and can safely get off of the massive cliff without dying by gliding down. This is where the game opens up. Before then you will have completed around four shrines and unlocked your basic runes, which will be helpful for the rest of the game.The basic runes are:Cryonis - Create climbable blocks in water. They are very stable, but if you put them in open water and accidentally swim under as Link, they'll break. They can be used to block enemy attacks, but larger, stronger enemies can break them (like a corrupted Guardian or a mini-Guardian that charges at you).Magnesis - Any metal object can be effortlessly lifted with this. Blades, shields, metal blocks, etc. You can use this during a thunder storm to create a lightning rod that you can float near enemies until the lightning strikes them. Handy, but mainly you'll use it on metal blocks to solve mini puzzles to find koroks (FYI korok seeds let you upgrade your inventory slots, so get them where you can and find Hestu near Kakariko Village... there are about 500 in total, but you only need like half of that to fully upgrade your inventory).Stasis - Freeze objects. Or enemies, once upgraded, although if you think you're holding a Guardian for more than a second-and-a-half, you're crazy. This can be used so you can hit it to build up momentum (great for flinging an explosive barrel at enemies in the far-off distance) or hold a flimsy object in place (like a bridge that is ready to fall) so you can scale it. It can also prevent electricity from flowing through an item during puzzles.Cube Bomb and Sphere Bomb - They're bombs. They explode. Sphere bombs are good for dropping down hills or fitting inside cannons at rare moments in the game. Cube bombs are good for throwing more precisely (they won't wander very far, usually).Unlockable Runes:Amiibo Rune - Turn it on in the settings after starting the game. Legend of Zelda amiibo unlock rare rewards in almost every case (save before using them if you want to try for a specific item since you can use them but once per day, resetting at 12 o'clock midnight). Want to look like Twilight Princess Link? Get his outfit by using the Twilight Princess Link amiibo every day. The game will actively help you by giving you a higher chance to get pieces you don't have than ones you do. I've never gotten a duplicate before getting the full set for my Link amiibo outfits. Afterwards you will, though. Oh and Wolf Link spawns him in-game with three hearts (more if you have a Twilight Princess save with more hearts available).Camera Rune - You get this at the Hateno Research Lab. Once you unlock its full functionality, it can be used to catalog enemies, weapons and plants so you can find them using the Sheikah Sensor+, the thing you will almost certainly use to find shrines. Very useful if you don't want to rely on guides. Plus you can take selfies (no, I'm not joking, you can even pose). It's needed for certain side quests, so I recommend getting it early on to give yourself more to do.Master Cycle Zero - Beat all four Divine Beasts, then start the Champions' Ballad DLC. This is the end reward and the entry fee may be a bit steep (some VERY tough shrines on the Great Plateau for starters). I really enjoyed earning it, though, after the initial frustration was over and it's better than a horse by miles. You'll need to keep it stocked on fuel, but literally anything can be used as fuel. Apples, Bokoblin teeth, etc. If it's in the material section, you can use it. I was hesitant about it before, but it doesn't feel as out-of-place as I thought it would and it's actually really fun to ride. Plus near as far as I can tell, you take ZERO fall damage while on it (at least if you land properly), so that's nice. Also, since it's a rune you can call it to you wherever you are (with the exception of Trial of the Sword and the Gerudo Desert, of course).Alright. Now that I've basically written more of a guide than a review, I think I'll stop here. I love the game. It's fun, it's gonna last you a long while, and it's one of my favorite Legend of Zelda games to date. The DLC lets you collect awesome novelty armor pieces, as well, so if you've ever wanted to wear Majora's Mask... well, there's a reason to buy the DLC, then.And hey, it makes most enemies leave you alone, too, since it has a disguise effect matching the monster masks of BotW.",

    "review Text": "I used to play Zelda as a kid, and thought I'd see how far things had come along in the last 30 years or so. This has been my shelter-in-place entertainment for the last couple months, and I beat it yesterday. Like everyone else, I loved a lot of this game, and became sort of obsessed with it. But now that it's done, there are two lingering takeaways that I wish would have been different:1) The weapon system encourages hoarding and doesn't leave you satisfiedBy the end, I had a TON of weapons in my inventory, half of which were super powerful ones that I really was looking forward to using. But then I beat the game, and didn't get a chance to do anything with them. Since weapons degrade, you end up using the crap ones and save the good ones for later, which means basically you don't ever get to use the good stuff.  I wish they had done a weapon upgrade path (like with armor), rather than encourage the crazy hoarding. I'm done with the game, but rather than feeling satisfied about it, I just keep wondering if maybe I should have pulled out that Ancient Bladesaw a few more times.2) What's up with Zelda?All the cut scenes show Zelda feeling sorry for herself, or crying in despair, or just generally being a sourpuss. What gives? Every time I saw another one of those, I felt less like saving her and more wishing she'd have just perished in the apocalypse like everyone else. If you're pumping that much time and money into developing a game, why not spend a little more time and writing a decent script for the backstory? This is not a difficult thing to do. And furthermore, as long as I'm venting, why is Zelda always turning away from the camera? It's a weird thing you say, but I'm pretty sure they did it to show her butt, and more than once (especially at the great fairy fountains, omg) I felt like I was watching cheesy video game erotica designed for 13 year olds. Come on people, you can do better.Anyway, those were my two gripes. But everything else was pretty amazing, which is why I'm still going to give it 4 stars.",

I know 2 of them are remakes from the N64 days but this game blows them out of the water. Before this one my favorite was a link between worlds as it allowed you to do things in any order you wanted after the beginning. Now this game takes that same freedom and opens it up into a 3d open world. I haven't finished the game but well over 25 hours into it and still about 2/3 of the map to explore is amazing to me. I don't get into open world games often but this games freedom makes it far above many of them. This is without a doubt the best game Nintendo has ever made and I can't wait to keep exploring and finding new armor and weapons and shrines. This game doesn't make you run around and find pointless collectables like most open world games. Everything you find has a purpose that will help you in some way. This game is near perfection.",

Yeah, totally didn't type of games, but I play a variety.Anyway, I love how this game is open-world and you can just about do anything anywhere. The developers were so clever with so many details. Love the game. It just keeps me interested the entire time that I never want to put the game down. It has also negatively affectedy life because I have become somewhat detached from everything else sort of. It's definitely a distraction.I didn't think my kids would care for the game but they also have become hooked. It's actually sorta cool because my 9 year old daughter and I totally have conversations about the game and watch youtube videos about tips and stuff. My 6 year old son who is also into the game sits there and helps me with some pretty good ideas. My kiddos are showing me that I keep underestimating them with their problem-solving skills and the ability to understand the game. So the game has brought our already close relationship even closer despite being a little detached from other responsibilities. Lol. And we have realized one Switch is not enough for the 3 of us.

It's hard for me to go back to other games after experiencing the ludicrous level of freedom, polish, and concept execution that Breath of the Wild achieves.

The Legend of Zelda franchise has been popular for a long time but this recent installment to the series takes it to the next level.  What makes Breath of the Wild so excellent  is it's free and open world nature.  Minutes after starting the game the player is greeted with a stunning view of the massive landscape and all the game has to explore.  The game play is less linear than other games and feels more like a self guided adventure like searching for shrines, conquering powerful enemies and stumbling upon villages and cool items .  This Switch game  is different from its predecessors because there are so many more options and room for experimentation.  I am still discovering new features sixty hours in.  The graphics in Breath of the Wild are phenomenal even in the hand held mode.  The game’s anime  inspired art style fits the fantasy world and the cartoonish characters well.  The creators of Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild spent lots of time and care adding all of the side quests, 120 shrines and 900 korok puzzles scattered across the map.  It would take hundreds of hours to one hundred  percent complete this game unlike most new games that are shorter than their originals.",

    "review Text": "Without a doubt, this game is a beautiful and amazing experience. It stands on its own and cannot be fairly compared to past Zelda games as it is a totally different experience. However, I will do a little comparing because I feel that the creators of this game listened to Zelda fans and applied all of the best of the constructive criticism to this game. Other Zelda titles notwithstanding, this game can be started by someone who had never played a single game in this franchise and feel like they have not missed a thing by not following the series from the start. Here are my pros and cons on the game as a long-time fan of the franchise:Pros~Absolute freedom to explore and die, like a lot.~Nintendo expects you to die quickly and starts you back at reasonable places after auto saving for you.~The voice acting!!!! YES!~Engaging story. I immediately felt sympathy for the story and felt the need to resolve it.~The graphics and scenery are beautiful. ~Interacting with nature, scavenging for food instead of whacking grass for hearts, running up on secret enemies (sleeping Hinox 😳), mining ore, discovering underwater treasures, climbing impossibly high mountains, etc. made me feel like a child again. I had the same wide-eyed wonder that I had the first time I stepped into Hyrule Field in Ocarina of Time.~I know some people hate that weapons break, but I would never pick up and try different weapons if I could just keep my favorites forever. Weapons, bows, and shields breaking forces me to find new solutions and problem-solve in tense environments. It makes winning a fight even more satisfying. I'm looking at you, Lionels. They always break my weapons.~All the best races and worlds are brought together in this game. I missed the Zoras in Wind Waker and always wondered how they didn't survive the flooding. Having the combination of the different unique Hyrulean races was truly magical.~The dungeons and bosses aren't the point of the game. I say that respectfully. The game offers so many points of exploration, from filling your Compendium to locating all the Korok seeds to discovering some impossible shrines to taming the best horses to cooking endless recipes...I think you get it. Defeating Ganon is an early task set up for you, but you can't possibly do that without preparation.~There is no irritating, interrupting little companion to make you feel like a complete idiot. The Sheikah Slate is a helpful tool, but it does nothing to hold your hand. You go where you want without something stopping you and suggesting another route. Phew.~This game doesn't hand you easy wins. You must continue to use strategy to outwit strong monsters. As you grow stronger, they grow stronger. Some monsters do take one hit to kill even late in the game, but others continue to require your wits to take them down. I loathe the blood moon, but I'm glad it brings back the powerful monsters I killed already so I can continue stealing their weapons and farming them for recipes.~For old Zelda fans, there are many, many references to beloved games. The Temple of Time, Lon Lon Ranch ruins, names of lakes, and especially Beedle are fantastic nods to seasoned players.Cons:~The rain is a serious pain. The climbing clothes should offset climbing in the rain, really. Considering how huge climbing is in the game, not having a climbing solution in rain is a major pain.~Link doesn't talk. As usual, the hero is silent. His expressions and body language are good, but I would have loved for him to talk in even the final cutscene. I felt myself feeling sorry for the silent hero.~All the extra money required for this game. Downloadable content and Amiibos. Sigh. The Switch is expensive. Now add $60 to that for a single game. Any game because it doesn't come with one. Now add in $20 per download for downloadable content. Now add in Amiibos. Yikes! This game feels like a money grab. A shameless money grab.~I want to keep the bow of light and attack the monsters of Hyrule with it. I. Want. It. Without glitching the game. I'd buy an Amiibo to get that bow.~True to Zelda spirit, the game ends without any real resolution. I'd like to explore Hyrule and take out the monsters for good post-Ganon. Like have a monster count-down until they are all killed. Then receive a very nostalgic item like a Navi outfit that enables Link to talk incessantly.That's about it. I loved the game overall. I feel so immersed in it. No matter where I go, I don't feel like I've truly explored everything. It's a great game for girls and boys alike. Did I mention that I'm a woman and a mom at that? And I adore this game. Get it if you haven't yet.",

A game that takes you back to the days of being a kid and getting lost in an incredible adventure.I've been playing video games since the regular NES console when my Dad brought it home in 1986 from a now long forgotten department store. I remember the days of sliding a cartridge in and getting sucked into the game, learning it's tricks and trying to uncover it's secrets. The older I get, and as games changed, I quickly realized that the trend now is big production values, high action set pieces, and little is left for exploration, discovery and charm. Outside of a very select few games in the late 90's and early 2000's, I haven't been able to feel that sense of wonder anymore.I decided to get the Nintendo Switch on a whim, the day of release. I went and stood in line for it to buy it at Midnight, and I decided to take a chance on a new system and this game, where I really haven't enjoyed an entry into it's series since Ocarina of Time on N64.That night, after setting the system up and popping this game into the console, I sat down. I did not leave my seat until 4 a.m. I finally found that game - the one to suck me in and give me a sense of exploration and discovery missing since I was a kid.Do yourself a favor, get it however you can, don't use a guide, jump in and relive the days of adventuring into the unknown.",

Link loves to start climbing a walls anytime you lightly brush them. He grabs on to literally everything he touches. 3D distance judging is off, making bow fighting frustrating. No easy way to replenish arrows without exploiting some little cheats so bow fighting is not very efficient. Items break way, way too fast.

Not only are the landscapes, OST and art direction brilliant, the gameplay is as well.  Everything just feels fleshed out, well tested and fluid.  Nothing ever feels cheap about the controls or combat, like annoying iframes or stuttering FPS.  The world is so immense and there are so many things to do that I never get bored and am always looking forward to my next play session.  If I start getting burnt out on searching for shrines, I'll take a break and farm items for armor upgrades.  If I get tired of that I'll start searching for Koroks, farm money for armor or complete some sidequests.  I've heard people say that the game is overwhelming and that they get burnt out on it but I think they aren't taking the time to sit back, enjoy the game and take it all in.  Don't rush through all of the main quests.  Explore and play the game like it was meant to be played.  One other complaint I've commonly heard is the weapon durability system (weapons break after a certain amount of use).  My response is to keep playing and wait until you see the mid to endgame weapons.  I liked the fact that I was forced to try a different type of weapon because my previous one broke.

However, my boyfriend is the biggest gamer I know and I like watching him play games, plus I loved video games as a kid so I was easily interested. I wanted a switch because of how well it had done and the millions of 5 star reviews (which are valid because the switch is sooooo good).BOTW was one of the first games I got for the switch and is easily one of the best games I have ever played. I’ve never played a Zelda game before, so I really had nothing to compare it to. Even so, I knew this game was the best one. If you’re thinking about getting it and are on the fence ... THIS IS YOUR SIGN, JUST GET IT. You won’t regret it!The vast open world is kind of a go-at-your-own-pace kind of game, which I really loved since I’m not that good at video games. It allowed me to explore (the scenery, monsters, animals, visuals, and people in the game are all exquisite) and complete side quests + shrine quests at my own pace without feeling rushed or pressured. As someone with intense anxiety and panics when forced to make a decision in a set time, I think this was the perfect starter game to get me back into the video game world and introduce me to Link and Zelda.That being said, it is not easy and definitely has its challenges (small tip, FIGHT THUNDERBLIGHT GANON LAST aka the Gerudo devine beast aka Neboris).

    "review Text": "When BOTW was shown last year at E3, I honestly wasn't impressed.  In fact, I kind of scoffed at it.  I've been a Zelda lover since it's first release in 1986 and it was probably one of my first game experiences.  Ocarina of Time was one of the my most anticipated games ever and it was so meaningful that I remember the exact moment I saw it on a play display for the first time.  But the Breath of the Wild trailer  left me severely underwhelmed and it was simply because of the graphics.  We all know that graphics don't make the game but, still, there are only so many games you can play so I didn't see the point in playing the ones that seem to take a graphical step backwards.How wrong I was.Over the past month, I've really been swayed to try this game not only by the the glowing reviews but more so by the promise that this was one of the first truly OPEN world games.  Like the first Zelda game, reviewers promised that gamers were completely free to do what ever they want within the game.  If you feel like it you could even go straight to the final boss from the starting point of the game (in fact, the first real main quest you get is actually the LAST quest to defeat the final boss �?BRILLIANT!).  And I also heard that the game was expansive and huge (in fact it's 1.5x larger than Skyrim's world!) and the idea of a open world Zelda game was something I dreamed of playing as a kid in the 90'sSo I picked up a switch for this game alone and I'm so that I did because it deserves every bit of praise it has received.A lot of people have been comparing this game to Horizon Zero Dawn and, I've got to say, Zelda: Breath of the Wild comes out as the superior OPEN WORLD game.  Now, that is not to say that Horizon isn't a system selling, must-own, masterpiece because it absolutely is! And that is not to say that Horizon is even technically less of a game than BOTW, because it excels in areas where BOTW is weaker.  Horizon is a superior game in terms of combat, amazing music, story line and emotional impact.  But there is an area where BOTW is better and that is the nature of freedom and the REWARD of exploration in it's world.Horizon's world is MADE by it's graphics, and they are incredible but after you finish the game the world is actually beautifully empty in a sense.  It took me about two weeks to beat Horizon and while I do plan on going back to explore for a couple more weeks, I really don't have any draw to do so outside of experiencing the graphics of the world.  In Horizons's end game, the enemies are the same power as they were before and you are now much stronger so the challenge aspect of the game is gone.  Also, there is no actual reward for exploring the world, or the rewards that you DO get for exploring are not at all exciting. Also, you are not able to climb every mountain or truly explore every element of the world like you could in real life. SO, while horizon is AMAZING and its world is beautiful there isn't a lot of draw to stay in it and keep exploring. This is THEE most critical element in an open world game!In BOTW,  you CAN climb every mountain, every tree, pick up every rock, smash any crate.  What that does is implant the idea in your brain of \"okay, if I see something that looks interesting I can ACTUALLY explore that area and I might find something great\".  Therefore you actually feel like you are a part of the game world and you want to keep coming back to explore. That truly opens up the world more than just having a huge world map to play around in. In addition to this, your weapons break and break often (which is one of games flaws that they break TOO often sometimes) and your inventory space is very limited.  But, hidden in creative places around the world, are special seeds that allow you to increase your inventory, which in tern allows you equip more items and explore even further into the world.  In addition to this, there are hidden shrines across the land that offer up interesting puzzles to solve; solve four puzzles and you are allowed to upgrade either your life or stamina (which allows you climb higher up mountains or swim further across lakes).It's this reward for exploration with a progression of character that is at the root of any truly addictive and masterful game. This is where The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild absolutely NAILS the open world format and surpasses arguably the BEST open world game that came just a week before it. Because at the end of the day, the most critical element in an open world game is not the graphics, not the music and not even the combat, but the sense of reward for exploration that truly brings the world alive!So, you need to absolutely purchase and play BOTH Horizon: Zero Dawn AND Breath of the Wild, but if you are asking me \"Which of these games is better as an open world game\", than it is hands down BOTW!",

    "review Text": "I don't want to write a novel regurgitating everything in the massive coverage available online or the features of this game. You can read up on that info in all its detail.What I will say is Zelda and Metroid are my two favorite game series and I have been playing games since the late 80s. I am also in the creative design field of sorts and I have been very critical of Nintendo's design decisions since Ocarina of Time was released. That game is a classic, but it strayed too far from series roots and left me feeling like it was a lost opportunity in some ways, while still being a great achievement in others, including the transition to 3D gameplay. But while 3D gameplay was revolutionary for Zelda, it was also restrictive: very clear cut paths with no exploration and taking choice away from the player, being hand-held by narrative, and conforming to gaming becoming mainstream by designing with instant-gratification in mind and fear of creating challenge and requiring skill-building. I have voiced my concerns to Nintendo and contributed a lot of comments in various ways. I am glad to see that enough people felt the same way about certain issues from certain Zelda games, with specific examples from Eiji Aonuma's recent interviews actually quoting almost exact complaints I had. I think Nintendo should continue its consumer feedback program because I hope they can see that all the perfect-score reviews of this game show that this method works.Zelda and Metroid at their core were the first successful open-world home console games. That was their genius--a true gamers game, as opposed to the casual addictive charm of Mario. I have been waiting since A Link to the Past to see if Nintendo would ever find their way back, while enjoying but at the same time being disappointed time and time again... Seeing glimpses of greatness but a sorptive unsaid and unfulfilled promise while I felt they experimented. 24 years it took them, but Nintendo is back doing it better than ever! Everything the original Zelda was--inspiring wonder, creativity in a marvelous world that one wants to be part of, feeling the sense of worthy accomplishment in mastering challenges, and also finally the sharing of each person's unique experience within that world. It's just that great.If you are born into Ocarina being your first Zelda game, there is a chance that this game may feel foreign to you. I would suggest to play it first to see if it is for you. That preconception that Ocarina was the epitome of a Zelda game may color your experience, but this game is really what Zelda was back at its conception and I think was destined to become once again.As a side note, I have a friend who played and finished the original Zelda and enjoyed it. He tried later Zelda games and got bored and quit and Twilight Princes (which I did enjoy as it's own game apart form my history with the series) left such a bad taste in his mouth that he can't take these games seriously. He has been playing Breath of the Wild for a few weeks now and that says something.",

This is by far the most ambitious, but for all the expanse, CGI and 3 dimensional puzzles, the game has turned too Japanese. Back in 1986 the game had so few pixels, it was impossible to tell the ethnic makeup of any of the characters. Now I feel like I am wandering round Japan in the olden days. The music is horrible, compared to the first Zelda. The non-linear, 2 dimensional, physics engine driven gameplay, however is superb.  It will give you months of enjoyment, in spite of several shortcomings. Worst feature is combining the forward toggle, with crouch action (by mashing the same toggle). You will die more from this feature than any intentional mistake. It will really make you upset. Second worst feature is the difficulty of DLC. You almost need to be a pro gamer to go forward in these. Once you get past the Start to Stop shrine you should  be okay. 3rd worst feature is the dialog. Half is for 2 year olds and the other half for adolescents. 4th worst feature, music. The accordion player must be revenge for Hiroshima. The credits at the end explain it all. Could have been perfect with some cosmopolitan input.",

Sometimes when I'm up high, I just look around to view the landscape; the style and detail looks like something out of a Miyazaki movie. And the music is so subtle it's just wonderful - just enough so you can hear the forest, wind, birds, or water.The gameplay is so well-thought out. The onboarding on the controls gently leads in and reminders in the HUD are always listed. Fighting is not too difficult, very forgiving, and just enough so as not to frustrate but pushing for curiosity. What I love most is the discovery and physics just to 'try' things. It's like Minecraft had some influence - cooking is really fun, bombs for fishing, lighting things on fire, making catapults, and the ability to climb anything. I found myself just spending hours just discovering new things with my newfound \"magical shrine powers\" around the Great Plateau arena (first stage). And when I finally felt comfortable a whole new massive world was out there waiting to be discovered.I find myself in awe back to my first Zelda game in '87 playing to midnight. 30 years later I'm doing the same thing! Even my 7 year-old loves it as well, but just not letting him stay up to midnight...Great, great job Nintendo! A 'must' to anybody that has a Switch.",

I had some frame rate issues very very uncommonly on the WiiU version during thunderstorms, and in the Switch version I have had no issues. It runs smooth as silk. The game is a great departure from the others in the series. It feels kind of like how it felt going from Zelda One to Zelda II, or Link to the Past to Ocarina of Time. This isn't a bad thing, but it's something to consider if you're on the fence about it and only like a certain Zelda playstyle. This version adopts an open world style, and while I am very tired of this genre, I have to admit they executed it perfectly. The Polish is unmistakable. It's similar to A Link Between World's in the fact that they give you all the tools you need very early, and then you can go in any order you want to progress the game. I mean, you can even go fight Ganon right off the bat; with sticks! The freedom and encouragement to be imaginative in how you approach puzzles and battles is what makes me give this 5 stars. My one gripe with it is while the music is beautiful when it shows up, it is not as prominent as it is in other Zelda titles which made me sad. That being said, when the music does chime on, whether it's a soft piano note or a village theme, it's beautiful and of utmost quality.",

Literally out of the 120 Shrines, over 20 of them are the same thing which is fighting the same enemy.  That is developer laziness.-  Inventory Management.  I don't really care for it.  I wish developers would of let you cook faster than what it allows.  I also wish there was a quick way to drop bows and shields faster similar to how you can throw weapons.-  Weapon/Shield Durability.  Some people hate it.

    "review Text": "It's certainly the biggest leap forward for Zelda games since Ocarina of Time did something similar for the franchise back on Nintendo 64. That said, looking at it strictly as an open world game, there is nothing that stands out, other than the fact that it has a Zelda skin on it.As an open world game, the content contained within is nothing new. Climb towers, unlock the map, repeat ad nauseum. It's nothing you haven't done better in the last 3 installments of the generally bland Far Cry series, much less Horizon Zero Dawn or Witcher 3.That said, on to the specifics.The Good:-The game is beautiful. Stylized art reminiscent of the Windwaker games. I always prefer the adult Link installments to the kid Link ones.That's really all the praise I can bring myself to sing about this very average game. And that's just to say it's been refined to the same exceptional degree that Nintendo typically does with their major titles.The Not-So-Good:-There really isn't much of a story here to unravel as you play. The whole story is obvious from the moment you finish the intro series. Even the ending was woefully boring and unsatisfying. There were no twists, nothing clever, nothing new, nothing special. It was incredibly bland. Zero interesting personalities within this game whatsoever.-The game seriously needed a skill tree of some sort. I found myself switching my armor sets about every 30 seconds sometimes just to get to the set bonuses I needed for all of 30 seconds to swim or climb or endure heat or cold. It's a very bad system. They should have just had levels and skill points and talent trees to improve your stealth, swim strength, climbing speed etc without having to change your armor 6 times inside of 2 minutes.-Weapon durability is the worst thing to happen to the Zelda franchise in... ever. It's awful. You can't even take care of or repair your weapons. They just break. Sometimes within 2 minutes or less of equipping it. The master sword is the one weapon that can't completely break. But it still loses 'energy' until it effectively breaks and triggers a 10 minute 'recharge' period. So even the master sword spent more time broken in my bags than it did in my hands. It was very, very disappointing.-Speaking of the Master Sword. When you get it, it's pretty much garbage unless you have the DLC. That DLC, rather than sending you on missions around the open world to empower your sword, has you stand right where you pulled the Master Sword out of the ground and queue for combat trials. That's not at all fitting for an open world game.-Speaking of the DLC. It's all pretty much trash. Armor that can't be upgraded. More trials where you die in one hit and kill in one hit. Compare this to open world games that really were revolutionary in their concept, like Witcher 3, their DLC made the entire game about 25% bigger by adding an entire new zone. Nintendo's DLC doesn't even qualify as effort by compare. It's very lazy. The bits of story contained within are throwaway at best.-And those armor sets are absurd. Upgrading them takes more effort than beating the actual game. I mean maybe in the Master Mode (hard mode) there is more reason to it, but that's not the core game experience. The core game experience provides very little incentive to chase down all the absurd materials needed for the highest level of upgrades, many of which are rare drops from mobs that there are only a few of, meaning you will kill them all, not get enough of the mats and end up having to wait for several Blood Moon cycles (the game's mob respawn mechanic) to get everything you need, and when you do get everything you need, the upgrade is so negligible that it went entirely unnoticed by me during my play through. A very high amount of effort for a payoff so small as to be almost imperceptible.- Cooking is one of those things that needed to be much improved or removed altogether. To have to sit there for 10 minutes dropping one fish at a time into the cooking pot just to get 20 of the cooked version is annoying. Then you open your food bags and instead of having a single stack of 20 of X food, you have 20 stacks of one. Food and Materials bags are unlimited in size, but to have 3 pages of the same food is... dumb.-Weather is a terrible thing in this game. Similar to the cooking, it's the manifestation of Nintendo's inability to decide whether or not they were trying to make a survival game or not. When it rains, and with the speed at which time passes in this game, it rains often. You can't climb anymore. So rain literally forces you to stop what you are doing, find somewhere dry, make a fire and then allows you to sit by the fire to speed time up. Of course, it'll frequently just start raining again 5 minutes later. I wonder who Nintendo thought this feature would improve the game experience for? Same goes for lightning. You can and will get struck 20 times in 5 minutes or less if you have metal weapons equipped. Weapons only, mind you. You can wear a full suit of metal armor and that doesn't make the slightest bit of difference. Nintendo is very inconsistent with their efforts to force survival game concepts into this game... for whatever reason they decided to do it. It only makes the game more frustrating. Never more fun.-(Shrine) puzzles in this game are very watered down. There are A LOT of shrines. After doing about 60 something of them, I couldn't be bothered to do the rest. If you've seen about 10 of them, you've seen them all. They are nothing compared to the dungeons and puzzles of previous LoZ installments. The 4 Divine beats which would be the closes thing to real Zelda dungeons in BOTW are okay at best. Still pretty mindless for the most part. And again, the sheer number of them, for the limited number of ways in which they could be diversified and kept interesting... It was a bad call on Nintendo's part. One of many in this game unfortunately.-Link also can't even swim across a pond without drowning when you start in this game. He literally has the stamina of a toddler. It's pathetic. You CAN upgrade it. But you will still find yourself constantly rotating through armor and such because ultimately he never becomes a proficient swimmer without the Zora armor. This is obviously done to give value to the Zora armor but, again, skill trees providing long term character advancement paths would have been the smart choice.-Oh, and the game starts you off with virtually no bag space for weapons/bows/shields. Apparently nintendo thought it would be fun if players had to scour the map for tokens that are exchanged for unlocking inventory slots one at a time. This means you are ALWAYS having to open your bags figure out which weapon to drop so you can take this new one you just found. 99% of the chests in the game are full of trash weapons that you wish you could just avoid in favor of your Master Sword, but the master sword has been reduced to the Mediocre Sword in this game as well.Ultimately this is a game that brought nothing new to the table. It took all it's queues from open world games that are several years old, took nothing from Witcher 3, which astounds me because it continues to be the greatest open world game ever. And in the end it was a less satisfying experience than even the old carbon copy Far Cry 3/4/Primal games, which provided at least SOME form of long term character advancement. Far Cry 3 gives you something loosely equatable to a hook shot. BOTW didn't even bother adding one at all. None of those fun utility items from previous games really made it into this one actually.I ended up abandoning my completionist play style and gunning straight for the last boss. I was eager to be done with it. It's very rare that I play an open world game that I don't want to get 100% map completion on. This game left me sorely wanting for a story with interesting personalities and interactions, of which there are literally ZERO in this game. I wanted so badly to love it, especially after all the rave reviews that drove me to buy a switch JUST to play it. Open world games are my absolute favorites but this game is a very poor example of one for 2017. Might have been amazing if it had launched in 2011. But, given what everyone else is doing with open world games these days, this game is hardly worth recognition at all beyond what it does strictly for the Zelda franchise.",

    "review Text": "This is a game with a stunning amount of heart and soul. Nintendo has put a Herculean amount of effort into this game, and it shows. When I fired up this game, I didn't know too much about it other than hearing great things about it, and I was absolutely blown away in the first hour of playing it. Even now, 90 hours into the game, I am still discovering things I have never seen and being surprised by things I didn't know were possible.This is hands down, once of the best games I have ever played. It is beautiful, complex, and breathtakingly enormous. I am not quite done with it, but even now I feel totally comfortable giving it 5 stars.THE GOOD:- Non-linearityThe game gives the player the freedom to play (largely) in whatever order they desire. This means that every player seems to accomplish things in different orders, meaning each player's experience is a bit different. Some players will say certain bosses were almost impossible, while other players that got to them late in the game will find them easy. I've heard some people say they didn't like this about the game, but I found it to be a really interesting mechanic.- FlexibilityMany of the puzzles in the game can be solved in wildly different ways. I have gotten through numerous puzzles only to find out I completed them the \"wrong\" way once talking to friends who completed them in different ways. That alone is impressive. This also extends to run-of-the-mill enemy battles, where you are offered an endless variety of ways to defeat them. You can defeat them the traditional sword-and-sheild way, or you can crush them with boulders, drown them, throw them off a cliff, or blow them up with powder kegs. It would be difficult to detail an entire list of ways you could defeat enemies.-Rewarding the playerNintendo has accomplished something rare in BotW by making the game challenging by way of discovery instead of pure skill. This makes the game insanely rewarding. Many aspects of the game don't necessarily require you to be a good gamer or have great \"video game skills\". The game regularly gives you an objective to which you will find yourself scratching your head and wondering \"How do I even...?\". Instead of mashing buttons, I’m finding myself looking up the definition of words like “garrison�?to figure out if I’m in the right spot on the map to solve a riddle. Figuring out how to beat these challenges provides endlessly rewarding \"Aha!\" moments.THE EXCELLENT:-StoryThe story, good lord the story! The story does an amazing job of getting you invested in the characters and motivating you to save Hyrule. Many of the cutscenes gave me wet eyes.-The MusicThe music is absolutely fantastic. Because the tunes are much more complex, they are perhaps not as catchy as Ocarina of Time, but they are just as (if not more) iconic.-DiscoveryThis is a game built around discovering things. Half of the fun is putzing around Hyrule and discovering villages, ruins, shrines, enemies, friends, etc. This makes Hyrule feel alive instead of a static environment. There are many discoveries peppered throughout the game where you'll find yourself stopping to absorb the moment.THE BAD:There are a few downsides to the game, though they are far and few between. I am probably missing a few - they are very small so it's easy to forgive them and hard to remember them.-Voice ActingThe voice acting, which is new for a Zelda game is a bit stiff. I think this is a result of translation since the game was (probably) originally scripted in Japanese. Still, I found myself loving the characters because of the voice acting and not in spite of it.-Tedious DialogueSome mechanics of the game require you to have repeated interactions with characters (i.e. buying arrows from merchants), and some of them include non-essential tips that they give you after you interact that are really annoying to click through after the 100th time.IN SUMMARYIn spite of the flaws others have found in the game, I have no hesitations calling Breath of the Wild a masterpiece. If you are not a Zelda fan, this game might change that. If you're someone who grew up playing Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask like I did, you should honestly consider buying a Switch just to play this game. It is seriously that good. I am in a position where I can proceed onward to the final boss fight and beat the game, but I simply don't want to. I have bought the DLC and plan on dragging it out as long as I can and will probably wait until the 200 hour mark to beat the game.As someone who grew up playing Ocarina of Time, I am a massive Zelda fan, but I think I will always consider Breath of the Wild to be the true sequel to Ocarina of Time because no other Zelda game has replicated the way I felt when I played OoT - until now.I already know this will end up being a \"nostalgia\" game for me in 10 years, and I'm already wishing I could experience this game for the first time again.",

Twilight Princess had a beautiful story but by the end of it it also felt too easy. That's where breath of wild comes in. The game play to this was different than the previous ones.

Durability was a good, bold decision, but its poor implementation is insufferable.  Giving items 50% more durability than they had would've fixed this.

In the past I'd enjoy a game off and on, but ultimately after a month or two I'd  two stop playing because it seemed  repetitive. I've enjoyed Halo, Portal, Doom , Skyrim, Assassins Creed. My older son asked for the Switch for his bday and have to say I was getting pretty exasperated trying to find it for him. Finally after 3 months we got lucky and found it at local store. I tell you this only to say that by the time he got the Switch I was kind of fed up with the process and not feeling too positive toward Nintendo. But, then I started to play and I have never felt so eager to play again. This game is somehow challenging and relaxing at the same time. There is so much to see and so many treasures/items to discover. I think it keeps my attention because you are constantly being rewarded. Also, there are plenty of monsters to fight, but after you clear out a group, you have quiet time and can actually just explore without feeling \"on edge\" that another one may pop out at any moment. This balance of excitement/challenge/exploration seem very different from prior games. My older son will be taking the game and Switch to college in the fall and I am seriously thinking of buying another one for myself and his younger brother to share. I have also been surprised at how this game has provided so much fun together time with my sons. We are all at different points in the game, but it's so interesting that we often watch each other play. (They are ahead of me and enjoy watching me try to get through challenges they have passed.) I'm not as good at fighting the monsters, but it has been interesting to find that some challenges that seem pretty obvious to me, are not so obvious to them. I think that is a another sign of an excellent game...its  challenges are quite unique and different folks can excel in different areas. Best game we've ever bought, by far!",

Gone are the giant dungeons where you have to keep track of the entire layout of the map. Instead, you're given way too many tiny dungeons, many of which are unsatisfyingly easy. They feel more like routine tasks to check off a list than the adventurous puzzles of past Zelda games.The only thing BotW has going for it is its massive world map size. But despite that it's 1000 bigger than OoT in size, it still feels like OoT has greater number of decent puzzles.",

They had gotten stuck in the very beginning and asked me for help a couple months ago.  I  had not played it at all up until that point.  Now I literally hide the switch just so it’s charged at the end of the day so I can play after they are all in bed;)  I setup my own user account just so they couldn’t mess up my progress!! Lol  One thing to keep in mind is that I bought the digital download version and it takes up a ton of space so I def had to buy a big sd card as we have quite a few digital games.  That way my kids don’t lose the games.  This game is amazing!  At first I will be honest I didn’t really feel the Switch was worth $299 but this game alone IMO has made it worth every penny!",

I'm not exactly a hardcore gamer, but I have been playing since the days of the Atari 2600 and have seen a lot of different types of games, but very few match the detail as I see put into every nook and cranny of every stone, tree, and weapon. For example, a lot of puzzles require the use of a magnet you get early in the game. The developers put a lot of attention into the physics of how to manipulate a metal object to the point where a knowledge of Newtonian mechanics actually comes in handy. I never thought I'd put my physics background to use in a video game.The second thing that really struck me was the fact that, at the beginning, there really wasn't much in the way of tutorial. I had absolutely zero clues as to what to do or what was going on and, frankly, I found it incredibly enjoyable. In the end, I cannot recommend this game enough.",

It's not perfect, but it's close enough to it that you're doing yourself a disservice if you allow yourself to get hung up on the minor issues it does have.The Legend of Zelda on the original 8-bit console was one of the first games I finished as a kid. I remember the hours spent in the basement steering Link through that world. Now my kids are getting to experience a game I can only say is breathtaking.I am a fan of open world games. This game is as good as (if vastly different than) The Witcher 3 or Skyrim. I do not find it embarrassing or childish, or lacking in any way. I flat out love this title, as does my wife (who was a big Ocarina of Time player) and my kids (who are being introduced to the series with this iteration)...Do yourself as a game a favor and play this title. If you have to play it on a Wii-U, play it on a Wii-U. If you're on the fence about a Switch but could afford it. Buy one as soon as you can get one for retail and play Breath of the Wild on it.

    "review Text": "To start, I'm a fan of the Zelda classics, haven't played all of them, and I don't think every Zelda game is great, but I do think the following Zelda games are fantastic games in and of themselves:  Zelda 2, Link's Awakening (Gameboy), Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time. Zelda Wind Waker, Majora's Mask, and to a lesser degree, Twilgiht Princess, are also pretty good in my book.That all said, I'd say the best Zelda game is still Ocarina of Time.  The game did so many things right, with catchy music, clever dungeons / puzzles, some of which really got you thinking, fairly engaging combat, likable and memorable characters and story.How does the latest Zelda, Breath of the Wild compare?  To start, I'll say I'm not typically a fan of open world games, but this game and Xenoblade Chronicles games are my exceptions.The world is vast, and the cell shaded look of the game is nothing short of breath taking.  The game was made to be played in any order and to be very open-world and free, so the main abilities are all found/obtained in the beginning.  There are of course harder enemies and higher mountains in some areas more than others, but you're able to roughly roam anywhere and tackle them in any order you like.The combat is interesting, because both Link and weapons start off being quite fragile.  You can expect, at least to start, to die a lot, as many enemies can one-shot Link and will do so.  Weapons can break and the controls take some time to get used to, which may seem like a downside as you may accidentally throw away weapons, or you wonder why you can't just go and hack and slash foes to oblivion like in past games, but on the plus side this means you have to be much more strategic in how you approach enemy encampments.  You can't just go in wildly swinging your weapon, as that oftentimes will lead to failure or weapon breakage.  Instead, you have to use the environment, runes, etc, or dodge, time, and block attacks to get better use out of them.  Aside from a bit of loading when a Game Over is reached, for the most part there isn't a huge penalty for dying.  The game will auto-save at various points to prevent a lot of backtracking should Link meet an unfortunate fate.The NPC's found are generally all well designed, and there's a fair number of interesting side quests you can embark on. Some are kinda more meaningless / standard RPG fetch quests, but they try and tend to keep it interesting by tying it to the everyday lives of the NPC's you meet.  Some of the dialogue in the game can be pretty clever/fun, and a lot of the NPC's either have that or some other quirks in their personality that is portrayed fairly well.In this game too, they introduce some voice acting.  Mainly during cutscenes, and Link isn't voiced, I thought everyone did a pretty good job of it.Where the game shines most, imo, is in the beautiful world (looks fantastic, the art direction is spot on, and there's nearly always something new / interesting just around the corner), the journey of progression to become stronger, interesting characters/dialogue, and sense of atmosphere.There isn't a lot of music in this, in actuality, most of the sounds you hear are atmospheric.  Literally, there's sometimes no music playing. This is a sharp contrast compared to the series, which usually has a very upbeat and driving rhythm to keep you going.  And while I love me some good Zelda music (indeed, one of Ocarina of Time's high points for me is it's soundtrack), for this game, though, I think the decision was the right one.  If you've played previous Zelda games, the lack of music really helps drive home the atmosphere.  The world is beautiful, stunningly so, but the feeling of untouched nature and quietness creates an unsettled kind of feeling, when mixed with random moments of tenseness/ battles / monster encounters.  That, and finding cutscenes / memories really helps drive home, again, the atmosphere, and really the difference between past events to present.  It all builds tension and anticipation for the journey you're on, as well as the eventual grand finale/battle.That, unfortunately, is where the game falls flat.  This game is largely about the exploration, progression to becoming stronger, and the journey to the end, but when it comes to the end, I felt like it was the weakest Zelda ending I've seen, and even a weak game ending in general.  One problem is with the final boss being cake and the way you have to fight, and the second just that the ending didn't really leave me with much impact/feeling.--SPOILER ALERT:-----Per the first item of the final boss, granted, the game world is pretty open, and there's a lot you can explore, do, and ways you can increase your abilities / strength such that you can be pretty overpowered by the time you reach the end.  The game's combat is, as mentioned previously, more about strategy than blindly rushing in sword swinging, so preparation is a key factor in that.  And that's fine, like other games (i.e. RPG's), if you go and do all the extra content you'll likely end up being strong to the point of breezing through the end/story content.  That's not quite what I'm talking about though here, as I feel I came to the ending with a fair amount of power, but not to the point of being severely overpowered, and I felt like the ending was easy as cake.  The final boss was poorly designed from a mechanical/gameplay standpoint, cause they could only be damaged by certain means (which I thought that was annoying), it would have been better if any attack at least sort of damaged the boss, but was just not effective, rather than pigeon-holing you to have to attack in a certain manner.  And once you did find how to do it, he basically just rolled over and died without any challenge.  While I suppose this was done so that more people could see the end and the game could be more accessible, a large point of the game was the progression of Link (getting stronger, in prep for righting the wrongs) and for increasing/clarifying the reason of why you were fighting and showing the contrast between then and now.  It's very anti-climatic to build up the feeling of 'everything is on my shoulders' and then have the final boss be as pathetically weak as he was.  I can only imagine how much more pathetic he would have been had I actually increased my strength an extra 25-50% by doing everything in the game. Also, the very final boss was also weak and kind of ugly/bothersome to look at (not to say bad guys need to look pretty, I mean the whites were too bright such that it felt like it would burn an image on the screen cause it was so needlessly bright).Per the second item of the ending itself,  It could and should have been grander based on the build up to the moment, but it's just kind of done when it's done, there's no mention / reference of any of the town people you helped along the way, no one shows they care that the world was saved.  I understand it's an open world game and so it's possible some people won't complete the same quests or maybe even run into the same NPC's, but even a small thing like showing Sidon, gorons, etc looking up at the sky and seeing the darkness clear, and having them smile or something, anything, would have been helpful.  Even if the player never meets a character, can still show them.  Then if there's no emotional impact it's the players' own fault (for not exploring and getting to know the characters and hence not relating), but for those that did invest, they should / could've been rewarded better.  Examples being, when the final boss is defeated, could have a big explosion or something and perhaps some of the fire / debris could hit one of the flowers, and the crazy flower lady (Maglene?) could like panic to put it out, get the spark/fire out, then sigh in relief), or that girl who likes guardians could either be hugging Rosco or just walking, glance at her pic, then continue walking, dependent on whether that mission was complete.  That'd be a great way of piqueing interest (in getting people to want to explore if they hadn't, and or be a good way of the game acknowledging the player's actions and 'rewarding them' in ways for it).  A great example of an ending done right is, again, Zelda Ocarina of Time.  That game went all out, playing a ...remix/rehash of different themes in the game, showing the townspeople as happy/dancing, etc, which tied everything up super well and instantly helped bring and remind the player, just how far they'd come and just how grand the adventure had been, and just how much had been sacrificed to 'right the wrongs, bring justice, defeat evil, restore piece, save Zelda', etc.  All that made Zelda's words and actions at the end a billion times more meaningful, and helped imo make that game among the greatest of all time.--END SPOILER ALERT:-----Some other misses, I felt, were that most all of the dungeons were too short/easy, especially compared to past Zelda games where the dungeons (or the puzzle elements in them) were the main focus.  Sure, some of the dungeons had me scratching my head, which I appreciated, but those were pretty few and far between.  Ocarina of time, on the other hand (at least from what I recall), had much larger and varied and interesting dungeons.I also felt like the game's main / key story elements were also a tad too long, or perhaps rather that they were too repetitive (because they followed the same format).  By the time I was nearing the end of completing the main quests, I was getting a bit weary of them and just wanted to get to the end.Finally, a gripe about the combat.  While the game did ramp up the difficulty and force more strategic combat, one problem is that some of that difficulty felt and was unfair, and second was that some of the combat can be made quite easy via exploits.  Per item 1, the unfair combat would relate to the end boss having only a limited means to defeat them, and basically any battle with a Lynel, and that enemies can one shot you too easily (at least in the beginning, after getting equipment upgrades then it becomes unfairly weighed on your end (imo) where you have way too much defense).  The problem with Lynels or other enemies isn't particularly that there attack is too high (such that they one shot you).  Somewhat, but the main issue is that they either attack too quickly and that the attacks aren't telegraphed. If you can survive multiple hits, it's less of a problem because you can adapt, but it's more of a problem because of one shots or because it takes off 70-90% of your hearts in a single hit.  Now, if the attacks were telegraphed and you had a fair amount of time to dodge or block and counter (and enemies didn't have ridiculous health, cough cough Lynels), then it'd be difficult but fair.  Here, they lean on the side of it being unfair (particularly, Lynels, most other enemy types are fine).A good example of how to do this right (a difficult, but fair battle system) is taking a look at the Mega Man Battle Network and Mega Man Starforce series of games.  Granted, the battle field is limited to 9 or 3 square grid, but the beauty of their system is that you can encounter an entirely new foe, but you have a chance of winning because most of the enemies strong/ultimate attacks are telegraphed, the panels that, say, are about to be hit by a rain of meteors, will flash yellow for a couple of seconds just before the attack lands.  Or, if the opponent dashes/appears in front of you and is about to attack you with a sword, or say a boomerang is going to come out and hit the perimeter of all the square grids, or a water geyser is about to explode from underneath you, or some bamboo spears are about to skewer you suddenly from behind / the back row, you'll always get some advance notice x number of seconds in advance via the floor panels flashing yellow just before the attack comes.While it may be less realistic, the gameplay would be many times better had all enemies done something like this, and could then be more difficult / challenging = more rewarding when the obstacle is overcome, yet still be fair (and have the players feel like any shortcoming/failure was a result of their own current lack of skill / reaction time / reading of enemy patterns, as opposed to the game being unfair). A good example of past Zelda games, is like Wind Waker, where you could swing your sword vertically or horizontally at different enemies, and at times certain kinds of sword strokes were needed to hit the enemies, else Link might have his attack blocked or countered.Second issue, is that while combat can be difficult or feel unfair at times, as you progress in the game there are some techniques which kind of break the combat and make it waaay too easy.  An example imo is that one can get a little too strong if you upgrade your defense equipment to the max (where's the fun if no one can really hurt you any more?), others are--SPOILER2 ALERT-------Using an ancient arrow to take out a Silver haired Lynel in one shot.  If you use any other means he'll give you heck, and deplete your food supply by like 30-70%, but you can shoot him with one arrow and...poof, he's just gone?  Sure, you don't get any items, but that just makes any fierceness or intimidation or really, anything, from those guys just disappear.  It's way too big a contrast, from being an enemy that's many times harder than the final boss to like stepping on an ant level of easy.  Imo, that could have been better.The second is advanced stasis, being able to freeze enemies is way overpowered, and it really shouldn't be able to affect bosses.  For Lynels, it's basically a necessity due to them being OP and way too fast and having way too much HP to decently deal with otherwise (aside from OP ancient arrow, of course).  For a lot of other enemies, it just makes 1v1'ing them cake.  Ignore their AI, just freeze, bash, run/ wait till recharge, and repeat.---END SPOILER2 ALERT----Oh, and lastly, it would've been nice (and not too hard from a programming standpoint) if they had a better hard mode for the game.  Currently that's only available via DLC, but it'd be nice if they had some in-game mechanics that players could optionally turn on to make things more difficult (like an in-game timer, a counter for number of times died, a way to skip the great plateau for starting a new game, etc).Phew.  That's a lot of text.  All said, in hopes for improvement in the future (for any aspiring game devs and whatnot), as I hope the game series, and gaming in general, improves on different points and continues to bring us good experiences.I don't want to make the game sound bad, cause as others have mentioned, this is the most ambitious Zelda game, and really, the world, visuals, and scope of the game really are top notch.  Like, astounding beautiful.  It's almost hard to believe a game world can look so colorful and good.  Traveling on the world is seamless, with pretty much no loading screens except when you start, die, and when you fast travel (and enter/exit dungeons).  The game is fun, has a lot of charm, interesting characters and dialogue, a lot of cool stuff to find and explore.  A lot of memorable moments too, either via cutscenes and the tension they create, or things like the always dark dungeon (that was a lot of fun). The dungeons, while oftentimes very simple and kind of pale if compared to previous Zelda games, were adequate at least enough to play through and be enjoyable in my first run through.  The combat generally is more interesting and strategic, and it is fun to play with different ways of best dispatching monsters (especially when they're in groups), and the AI is smarter and more interesting.The atmosphere and tension created in the game is fantastic, unfortunately let down and falls flat because the ending is pretty weak, but for the journey and through the cutscenes I could feel the emotion and tension quite strongly.  The music is different, not as in your face as other Zelda games, but because of that it creates the atmosphere, and when music does play it is very impactful due to it's rarity.I feel like this game is pretty good, due to it's open world, non linearity, and physics based world allowing for more strategic combat / solutions to puzzles, make the game fun to watch, and allows a lot of people to be able to play the same game, yet come out with different experiences from it.  I'm sure we all approached the different puzzles/scenarios in different ways, so it's kind of cool in that sense.Being that the game is as popular as it is, would I want future Zelda games to follow Breath of the Wild's format?I think BotW is fine as a standalone title, but no, in general I don't want them to follow to strictly to a formula.  I prefer Ocarina of Time, so that format would be better to follow (if any), but some games like Twilight Princess felt stale in the gameplay department because they tried too hard to follow OoT and formulize it (i.e. get a new wep in a dungeon and use it 3x to beat the boss of that dungeon....that's not fun if all bosses follow that).  There are general concepts that should be followed, like making boss fights interesting and not repetitive or super limited in how they are defeated, make the ending remind players of how far they've come along, but aside from those, it's generally better when they innovate and try new things imo (or most of my gripes are when they get too repetitive with a thing/formula, or dumb it down too much, so not doing those things).Gameplay: 8.2/10Some dungeons are good, but those are a bit few and far between.  Main dungeon format gets repetitive by the end. Do have some very interesting dungeons and memorable dungeons / gameplay moments though.  World is big, but sometimes a pain to walk through (can kind of fast travel, but I did a looot of walking).  Auto cruising on your horse on a road is a great feature and relaxing way to explore/travel, though.  Combat is generally good, but quite exploitable later down the road, and the last boss is cake. So some pretty good moments, but gets averaged down to a lower score due to some fairly large/glaring flaws.Graphics: 10/10For looking great, but particularly for the world being as beautiful, full, and interesting as it is.Story/characters: 9It's not a pure RPG so there's less emphasis on characters in this kind of game anyway, but there are a variety of interesting characters you meet, and Zelda is pretty well fleshed out (helped by some good VA). Extra points for a solid atmosphere, weakened by a weak ending.Sound: 8.8Not much in terms of music, but it happens to work for this game and adds a lot of the atmosphere, and makes the music that is there more impactful.Overall: 9/10Not the best Zelda game, but a great open world exploration game with fun characters, a great tense atmosphere, and memorable gameplay moments. Combat is good but exploitable over time, ending is pretty weak.",

    "review Text": "New 3D Zelda game releases are always a big deal. Since Ocarina of Time released to perfect reviews back in 1999, the bar was set so high moving forward. This time, however, instead of taking a cue from Ocarina, Nintendo opted to take things way back, back to where it all began. Breath of the Wild carries DNA from the entire franchise, but it mainly attempts to bring back the \"open-world\" aspect that the original 1985 game started, that subsequent games have sort of lost with their story progression and hand holding mechanics.In this game, Link wakes up after being preserved for 100 years in a closed chamber. Link doesn't remember much of anything, but he wakes to a completely devastaded Hyrule. A mysterious voice urges him to wake up and help bring back peace to the land of Hyrule by destroying the evil that has taken it over, for he is the chosen one to do so. I mean who else would it be?Zelda BOTW breaks so many 3D Zelda conventions that it barely feels like a Zelda game. I personally see BOTW as the lovechild of Zelda, Minecraft and Xenoblade Chronicles. Some classic Zelda elements are still there: there are still puzzles to solve, enemies to defeat, dungeons to clear, items to collect and so on.  But then there's a lot of this game that feels like it's own new experience. The game's overworld is enormous. You really can't capture how large it is until you are actually there playing. It is so huge that so Link gets to climb most surfaces freely, and even glide through the air, and whatever you see in the horizon you can actually get there. There are countless mountains, rivers, caves, beaches and other landscapes to explore. You can interact with pretty much everything you see. You can cut down trees, collect fruit, fish, roll boulders down slopes and more. Even in a post-apocalyptic setting, Hyrule has never looked so beautiful.Instead of the traditional items like Hookshots and Deku Seeds, Link will go through puzzles with his Sheikah Slate, which is essentially a tablet (a Switch maybe?) that activates some powers via \"runes\". This powers include bombs, magnetism, and freezing objects in time. Since the physics of this game expect you to use these and other environmental objects to your advantage, you are not always limited to go about things one way. You can do pretty much anything you want to achieve was is needed. Seeing how players worldwide have exploited these mechanics in creative ways has been fascinating to watch.The game's few shortcomings won't actually show until you have already invested 100 plus hours into it, so whatever I could say in those regards is by no means intended to diminish the awesome game this is. But I can say that the openness and freedom that BOTW provides comes with its series of consequences. In order to sort of restrict you from going too far or spamming items too easily, there are mechanics set in place such as the stamina bar, slippery climbing when it rains, breakable weapons, and more. Depending on who you are you may see these are merely part of the gameplay, but others really don't enjoy any of these \"features\". There's also the fact that this new Hyrule is at times too big for it's own good, with a lot of empty spaces. With the added destruction of everything, it makes the game a bit depressing sometimes.With that said, this game is so good that even a play session of just walking around aimlessly watching the landscape can be very satisfying.For every Zelda fan this is a must have. For everyone with a Nintendo Switch or Wii U that enjoy open ended adventures, this is definitely a must have. This is a great game to either end your Wii U experience, or begin your Nintendo Switch experience with. It is certainly, a breath of fresh air.",

    "review Text": "I love the Zelda franchise, and it pains me to say this, but BOTW is SO boring for one primary reason--It has no objectives outside of eventually getting around to killing Ganon (which is arguably the most disappointing final boss fight of any Zelda game, but that's another discussion altogether).Sure BOTW is beautiful, vast, and seamless mechanically, but it is inescapably one dimensional...traverse, traverse, gather, hunt, climb, traverse, climb, etc...That's the game.  There is literally (wait for it) ONE required mission in this game, and it's at the very beginning in order to obtain the glider so you can leave the plateau.  Coincidentally, this is the only section of the game I felt any compulsion to replay.  After that, the game is effectively over.  Nintendo had a great idea with a more open world Zelda, but it HAS to be married to progress requirements or the game ends up a meaningless walking simulator (as another reviewer put it).  Initial impressions of the game are astounding, but again, once you move into the heartland of Hyrule, you're essentially left with nothing of substance to do.  What you can do is get into literally an infinite number of small, meaningless skirmishes only to wear out and break your weapons, at which point you get to exchange them for...a sweet club or spear that does 1/8th the damage of your previous weapon.  SIGH.  I wanted to love this game so badly, but alas, a spade is a spade, and unless you dig filling your inventory with gems and meals, climbing all the mountains and gliding off them (arguably the only replayable fun thing to do in the game), or re-exploring all the same areas for the 100th time, BOTW will ultimately disappoint you.  I sincerely hope the next installment will learn from this \"miss\", and Nintendo will take the good parts of BOTW and combine with the classic elements of the Zelda franchise, such as large primary dungeons (also missing from BOTW), complex boss fights (also absent), and above all, mission requirements to give the game structure and meaning.",

If you played Ocarina of Time, this game is as big as that game felt the first time you stepped into Hyrule Field. It's really cool.I finished the main story at about 140 hours and I haven't even seen the entire map. It's huge! You can play it much faster, you can blast the story and get it done in 40 or 50 hours (it sounds like that's what most people are doing.) But you can do more and uncover more if you play it more, and believe me, none of those 140 hours were spent doing nothing.Its story and mechanics slot in perfectly with its open world format. The combat system is perhaps a bit frustrating at first if you don't play other open world games (I don't) but becomes a lot of fun and very engaging with time.The story is great for anybody, this could be your first Zelda game and you'd enjoy it. Or if you've played every single title up to it, there's a lot of rich content and deep meaning in a lot of what you experience.It also excels at teaching you through playing. There's no hand holding in the beginning, no silly Z-target test, no minigame to teach the mechanics. It gets to the good stuff right away.Zelda fans may also wonder how, with such an open design, it'll manage certain iconicisms that defined older games. It's all there, no worries.In many ways, it embodies things that Zelda's designers have wanted to do for a long time. Wind Waker was a shot at a huge world, but it was reined in by the Gamecube's technical ability. Ura Zelda was supposed to have the sort of object permanence that BOTW has, but it never made it to release. And every game has pushed a bit harder at having a bigger, more living world. BOTW is a natural evolution for the Zelda series, and any fan will enjoy it.",

To me, no other Zelda game has been as fun, challenging, and engrossing as OoT (though Majora's Mask came close), until now. Legend of Zelda has finally outdone themselves. Breath of the Wild is excellent; arguably the best game I have ever played. I would give it 6 out of 5 stars if I could. I haven't been this wrapped up in a game in years. I just can't put it down! The only thing that annoys me about this game - and I mean the ONLY thing - is that you cycle through weapons so quickly. I prefer melee weapons, and they break about every 3-4 enemies. I just have to get used to carrying a lot of backups. I have always said that OoT was a perfect game, and now I can say the same about BotW. Buy the Switch just for this game. If you have a Switch and you DON'T have this game, you better work on correcting that quickly. ;)",

The story is awesome, so is the voice acting, and I love it. Just imagine the perfect game, take out .002% of the imperfection and that’s this game. I’ve already explained that the majority of the game is fantastic, I’ll explain the bad parts.1. TAKE YOUR TIME. I got this and my switch right before I went on a series of long plane rides, so I kind of grinded it. I ended up beating it in two weeks, and that lost a lot of the magic. Spend as long as you can on it, get DLC, do all the shrines, find koroks, but DON’T RUSH IT. If you are like me and want to complete it 100%, do it before going to Ganon! Since my first play through was rushed, I lost a lot of the magic in it and it’s not the same the second time around. Savor your time like a fine liv-I mean fava beans and a nice Chianti.2. Play it on your TV. I cannot emphasis this enough, on your first time, dock it and play on your TV. Only do handheld after a while, but when you first turn it on, do it on your TV. It is so much more thrilling and whenever I dock it’s like a breath of fresh air. The lighting, the small details, it’s just so much better. DO IT ON YOUR TV. It looks kind of bizarre up close, maybe because I’m near sighted but I notice so many details that bother me up close.I do wish it was more story driven like in older Zelda games, but I stilled had an insane amount of fun, and in the trailer, we hear the best instrumental song EVER. But it the actual game, we only hear a few unique ones, otherwise it sounds like a man holding a small handheld fan to wind chimes in a shoebox. All in all, get it and NEVER regret it.

I agree. BUY THE SWITCH FOR ZELDA. So. Good.If you're used to an XBOX or PS3/4, the controls are really challenging at first. I believe you can change them, but even if you don't, you'll get used to them. The Go and Back buttons are just different than you'd expect.

I was in either kindergarten or first grade, and the entire world sucked me in. The characters, the landscape, the story, the enemies, the music... It all was such a magical experience. I've replayed OoT probably 20 times by this point, and it will always have a special place in my heart.Fast forward to 20 years later, I held off on purchasing BotW for two years since I was cranking hard on a life project. I had avoided all spoilers (no YouTube, nothing from the Zelda subreddits, etc.) and went into it completely blind. Walking out of the Shrine of Resurrection and seeing my old friend Hyrule reimagined on the Switch was so special, it legitimately made me tear up. I tore through the game, enjoying every minute of it, and downloaded all the DLC (super worthwhile, by the way), even beating Trial of the Sword on Master Mode (which to this day I'd assign a Dark Souls-level of difficulty, which is rare for a LoZ game).There were so many thoughtful nods to earlier LoZ games that the entire experience was as close to perfection as I can imagine. I cannot recommend this game enough - if you're on the fence about it, go ahead and pull the trigger because I promise you will not regret it.",

    "review Text": "The combat is punishing due to having very low life compared to enemy damage output for the first 5 hours or so.  Once you get ahead of the curve and get some decent armor it's okay, but in late game regular enemies become damage sponges and there's nothing you can do about it.  Strangely, the Guardians never get stronger, so eventually they become easier to kill than the strongest bokoblins.Exploration is top notch.  The world has lots of hidden things in it (mostly koroks) and you gradually gain equipment that makes exploring easier.  Horses are present but can't climb cliffs so in some areas you'll be leaving them behind.There aren't really any dungeons.  Instead, scattered throughout the land are shrines that usually contain a puzzle to complete.  Some shrines are combat challenges against a single miniboss.  The main \"dungeons\"-- the four heavenly beasts-- are somewhat shorter than dungeons in other zelda games and don't contain much in the way of combat except for of course the boss encounter in each one.  I'm not sure what's with the final boss's location since I haven't beaten the game, it doesn't look like a dungeon at all but maybe it changes when you start fighting the boss.",

Huge world gives you plenty to do and keep you busy, or you can skip it and head straight to the final fight if you wish (but what fun is that?).Graphics are great and the art style works really well for this game. Nintendo managed to make its open world still colorful and inviting (as oppose to Skyrims dark and gloomy). The resolution works for the system and I haven't noticed any hickups or frame skipping.Controls are good, but this does use the + - keys extensively, which are a little awkward to press on Switch controllers. Nintendo has used Motion controls wisely in this game. Making it highly useful while also not dependent. It is enabled only when you need it to be so it doesn't ruin camera controls.Gameplay is fantastic and a ton of fun. Although i kinda miss the big dungeons from previous Zelda games, The beasts and Shrines are a cool replacement and give you reasons to explore and find them all. I also found the puzzled ones to be enjoyable, not super easy, while also not frustrating. The fights are interesting and the fact that there are multiple ways to beat most of the monsters adds great variety.Music is awesome and really pulls you into the world while also not being intrusive or obvious.Best game for the Switch so far, and I dare say, might be the best Zelda game thus far, if not equal to Link to the Past (which is also my favorite).

I've been a loyal Zelda fan since I was 5 or 6 years old and I can honestly say that the developers of this game went above and beyond any expectation of the fandom to create this game.

Unlike most Zelda games, Nintendo chose to focus on the visual rather than the auditory, which is an interesting side step, given OoT, Link's Awakening, Majora's Mask, etc. But they chose this route well.There are ample side quests (and even more, if you buy the expansion, and I highly encourage you should) along with an interesting main quest for Link.

I decided against getting a switch till now and sold my wii u along time ago. breath of the wild did not interest me at all.  the weapons breaking turned me off, and the fact there is only 4 dungeons didnt seem like enough. now I wish I could have bought a switch on launch day just so I could have played this game sooner. such an amazing game, enjoyed every minute of it. make sure you get yourself a pro controller. the switch controllers are fine, but with my big hands the buttons are small. I constantly would be holding my shield up and manage to bring up my statis powers during the battles. that problem was resolved with the pro controller.  the only draw backs of the games are these.enemy variety is kind of lacking, you'll be attacking the same enemies through out the whole game. . weapons could last a little bit longer, I have used my whole weapon stache on one lynel.  NO FISHING?

    "review Text": "Out of all of the Zelda games I've played, this is so far my favorite one.  I can't say that I was surprised as to why this is the best game on the Switch, because there are so many things Nintendo did right with this game.  First of all, the most obvious thing, this is the most beautiful game I have seen, and this was a game that was originally developed for the Wii U.  The cel-shading provides a nice color palette and makes the game look like a work of art in motion.Gameplay-wise, tough, is where it shines even more though.  Where I kind of describe most 3D Zelda games more like 3D Metroid-vania, where it's more of open-ended game that's set on a linear path, this game is more on line with Fallout or Skyrim, where you can just go wherever you want at anytime.  You don't even have to go through the story to beat this game, you could just go straight to Ganon and fight him, though with the way the one boss I fought was, I don't recommend it until a second playthrough.  The gameplay also has a bit more survival element, such as weather effects such as lightning striking the ground, breakable weapons, and cooking, which gives you additional bonuses other than just health.  The world itself is also a pretty good size, and the thing is that I don't feel like it's that empty as compared to other open-worlds, where some of them won't even have anything happen as you walk those in-game miles, and with the map having no markers, other than what you put on there, I find that the game promotes exploration a bit more.  I think the one thing I will knock the game for are climbing the towers, but at least they could be used for scouting out nearby areas for shrines and secrets.  Combat is also pretty fun, but you always have to remember that weapons do break.I also think the sound is well done.  This is the first Zelda game (that are not from the Phillips CDi anyway) to feature voice acting, and I think they done a pretty decent job.  You don't hear the voice acting all the time (in fact, I don't think most characters get no more than short sound clips), but when the game shows a cinematic, the presentation is pretty good.  The music, however, brings this game to life, and from the dramatic to the more playful tunes, the soundtrack brings a bit more atmosphere to the game.If you have a Switch, or even a Wii U, this game will be an easy recommendation.  This is a game that is worth playing, and believe me, you will more than likely put in a lot of hours into it.",

If you want to defeat the final boss right at the start, you're allowed to.

Twilight Princess is close maybe this one will become my favorite after I get all 120 shrines.

When I first started the game I was a tad hesitant as there was little to no information given, and after playing a little while figured it was part of the \"experimenting\" process of the game, as I began to work on recipes and such. As I progressed through the game I remembered why I love past Zelda games I played. You see they have a little of all the genres I enjoy to play all mashed up to keep you hooked on playing the game. I truly enjoy Action/RPG's and there is a tad bit of RPG feel to this game with Health and Stamina bar upgrade. I also like there are puzzles, and strategies that are involved. Pros:�?Open World: This is the aspect I wasn't too sure about in the beginning as I have played others games in the past i.e. Oblivion, and didn't like how it was so easy to get caught up running in circles. However I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself setting a beacon or placing a mark which would keep me focused on the task at hand, and found myself not getting distracted and running in circles. Gameplay:�?Fighting system and strategies needed when facing 2 or more enemies at one time.�?Making food/elixirs by combining different items, this adds more depth and playing time.�?The various levels of difficulty ranging from very easy to extremely hard. Replay Value: The replay value is very high. There isn’t many games once beaten that I go back to replay. The reason for this is the vast amount of gear/items/shrines, and other things to explore. Cons: Gameplay:�?View changes can making playing more difficult than necessary at times.�?Riding horses is frustrating and very difficult to learn, even if it is one of the quickest ways to travel.�?Graphics: The overall graphics had my wanting more I have other Nintendo Switch games and have seen better graphics from them. The in game graphics are outstanding was just expecting more from some of the cut scenes.�?Lack of Instruction: I understand this is a huge part of the game, however at times takes away from the game.With that said I am finding this game becoming one of my all times favorites right up there with FFX, ad would highly recommend this game to anyone that likes a challenge, the freedom to roam, and to do mission’s in the order they like.

That being said the visuals do lag moderately behind my PS4 and far behind my PC.

This is one I play the most for sure and takes the most time -- I HIGHLY suggest buying the expansion pack with the two DLC's from the Nintendo shop.. I think it's around $30 but trust me it's worth it - Great value for your money and you will definately want to revisit Hyrule once you complete the main mission and side quests someday.  This game and Mario Odyssey are worth buying a Switch for.  Don't know how they plan on topping this but it's Zelda so we'lll see - Can't wait to try the expert / hero mode which makes the battles and game more challenging as some of the battles could of been more challenging in the normal mode of the game.",

If you're looking for a game to play with your kid/s I highly recommend this. Hours and hours of solving puzzles and working things out together has been very rewarding. Admittedly, we did have to look up a LOT of the gameplay online but it was just part of the fun.This was our first Zelda game and we have loved learning about the world of Hyrule and the wonderful characters within. It has also been incredible to watch my little girl become so adept at gaming. She was mostly the one at the controls, and was the one to defeat ganon in the end. I don't think I'd recommend it for children younger than 9, especially if they frighten easily, as the bosses and even some of the more minor enemies (ie lynels) can be quite scary.The only disappointing part of the game was the anti-climax at the end. After the epic effort to get to that point, we were expecting a bit more of a celebration and a pat on the back for our hero Link. But I can't bring myself to take a star off for that is it's a minor negative in a game full of positives.",

I don't see how this could be better than older games in the series.Whether it's better or not is up to each person, but it is definitely a welcome breath (heh) of fresh air into the zelda formula.  After it was all said and done, I had over 75 hours into the game (not including any DLC) and was very satisfied with the experience. What I found most impressive, was the developers forethought and planning to make not only a huge and interesting world, but fun gameplay mechanisms that make the player want to seek out new things (for example, I loved Korok hunting). I feel like they put everything under a microscope and said, how do we make this even more fun? Mr. Aonuma and the whole development team did such a fantastic job.",

    "review Text": "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is not only the latest entry into The Legend of Zelda franchise, but it is also the launch title for Nintendo's latest console, the Nintendo Switch. To say it has big shoes to fill is an understatement. The game offers a fresh look to the franchise's story and gameplay while still retaining the identity that many fans have come to know and love.The story of this game is a classic concept: Hero wakes up, hero receives mission, hero embarks on an adventure. As usual, you are eventually given a mission to save Princess Zelda and Hyrule. This has been a staple of the Zelda franchise, and it's no different in Breath of the Wild. However, after Link wakes up, the game takes a different path. In past Zelda games such as Ocarina of Time or Windwaker, the story has a set order. Yes, there are side quests, but core events must be followed in a linear fashion in order to progress the story. Not only that, previous Zelda games limit where the player may go until getting an item to allow access to the area, such as the hookshot or hover boots. Breath of the Wild is different whereas you may choose to go, and do, where ever and whatever you want. While this style is a departure from past Zelda games, it is actually a return to the concept of the first Zelda game in which the dungeons may be completed in any order.The dungeons in Breath of the Wild seem lackluster compared to previous Zelda titles. There are four main dungeons in Breath of the Wild before heading to Hyrule Castle. However, it should be noted that you can simply go to Hyrule Castle immediately as the game does not have the linear element of previous games. However, the dungeons offer two main benefits: they give you a special ability after completing them, and they make the final boss fight easier. While the four dungeons are well designed and fun, the dungeon maps are difficult to read, and otherwise detract from what is an excellent dungeon design. The length of the dungeons also fell a bit short, and I found myself wanting more. Much of puzzle solving aspects have been given the role of shrines. These shrines are like miniature temples which contain some sort of trial that must be completed. Sometimes, just getting to the shrine is the trial. While the shrines are fun, I would have preferred longer and more numerous dungeons. The puzzle solving aspect in Breath of the Wild is also very different from previous Zelda games. In previous Zelda games, there was one set way a puzzle must be solved, or one set path that must be taken to progress the story. Breath of the Wild allows for different approaches to puzzles. For example, do you fight the enemy blocking your path or simply climb the wall and go around?The introduction of cooking food in Breath of the Wild offers another departure from staples in the series. In previous iterations, you could simply cut some grass, break a rock, or smash a pot to regain hearts. In Breath of the Wild, all hearts must be obtained by eating food. Another aspect that cooking food introduces is changing certain stats such as temperature, resistances, strength, stealth, and speed. This brings Breath of the Wild closer to other RPGs like Bethesda's Fallout. The fact that items may no longer be obtained by randomly cutting grass, breaking rocks, or smashing pots also makes collecting rupees much more difficult. You cannot simply do one of those actions to collect rupees, you now much work for them through selling food, elixirs, or loot. However, is that there appears to be no rupee cap as in previous iterations. These changes are neither good nor bad, just different when compared to other Zelda games.Sound in Breath of the Wild is different from previous games in the series, both in the form of music and voice acting. Music has played a big role in The Legend of Zelda franchise, and much of it seems to have been toned down in Breath of the Wild. However, that appears to be because the open world concept of the game is suited for more ambient, relaxing music. Different music will play during cutscenes or enemy engagements. In fact, the music that plays while fighting a guardian is exhilarating. Would I prefer the classic overworld theme while riding my horse through the open fields of Hyrule? Of course, but the music in Breath of the Wild is appropriate, and it works. While it doesn't have full voice acting like Skyrim, Breath of the Wild still has voice acting—a first for the franchise. The voice acting is executed well, and allowed me to connect more to the characters than if I was simply reading text on a screen. Mipha, Zelda, and the Great Deku Tree were all voiced exceptionally well.Gameplay is where I had the most difficulty. The game is a lot more difficult at the beginning, and I died—a lot. At first, it felt like I was playing Dark Souls with a Zelda skin. Random boss fights would happen out of nowhere, or the game would trick me into speaking to a traveler only to have the traveler reveal themselves as an enemy. This was extremely problematic for me at the beginning of the game, and I found myself simply running away. However, as I gained access to better equipment and armor, the game got easier. Enemies in previous Zelda games would often have \"weak points\", but this isn't true in Breath of the Wild. Sure, you can do headshots, but the idea that you must hit this monster in one obvious place is much less emphasized. Every enemy has a life bar, and you must deplete that life bar to defeat the enemy. How you do that is entirely up to you. This brings the game more in line with the developer's goal of making it a more open concept, do what you want kind of game.Overall, while minor issues exist, Breath of the Wild is a fantastic game that is having the same effect on the franchise that Ocarina of Time did. Breath of the Wild will most likely appear on \"Best Game of All Time\" lists for decades to come.",

So of course I was drawn to this game by word of mouth, and I must say I am thoroughly enjoying it.  If you took a chunk of GTA, a dash of Assassin's Creed, and equal heaping parts of Skyrim and The Witcher 3, ran it through a food processor and crammed it all into the McDonalds Happy Meal bag that was Ocarina of Time, you get Breath of the Wild.  It is a feast to be savored. Yes, the weapons breaking is a drag. But this game has not left me without.  So far throughout my exploration (of which I'll never get tired of,  I mean HOLY CRAP every nook and cranny reveals a reward to be had) I have not yet been made to feel like I was unprepared, which great feeling.  It's challenging but it is FUN. I've had to google how to surf on my shield,  but other than that this is the first game in years that while playing I have actively restrained myself from getting the quick solution to the puzzle.  I won't let myself Google what is going on with all the pinwheels scattered about the land.  But I have them pinned, and when i figure it out I'll have a big reward waiting I'm sure.  In fact nearly every aspect of this game, for all of its challenge, is best approached with a laid back attitude.  This game was made by people who \"get\" gamers like me.  A word that gets overused lately is 'epic' but that is the best way to describe this game.  Pure joy.  I bought the Switch just for this game based on Amazon reviews.  Thank you,  Nintendo.",

Many great games have come after it but none could quite capture what I felt when I played OOT over and over back in 1998. Lo and behold, Breath of the Wild, a game I knew would be great that looks to topple OOT off that 20 year mark at the top.I haven't finished it yet but I've logged in 64+ hours thus far and haven't completed the game.  There hasn't been a game in recent memory where I wanted to take as much time as I wanted with. The sense of exploration and discovery is vast and renewed in this game. It takes the Zelda formula, multiples it by two and takes western game design, namely open world gameplay, to another level with the physics placed into the design. Smash a metal crate to one side of the river to another, swoop up into the air by lighting the grass on fire and creating a gust of wind to help lift you off.Art wise, I'm a fan of the movies from Studio Ghibli and the visuals, colors and light, remind me so much of Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away and others. A game where you will tend to walk and run from place to place, and takes up some of your time, is asked to almost require the beauty you can see from when the sun drops and rises, to the colors in the sky, the landscape that changes radically from place to place and the beauty hidden in every corner that pops into your eyes. It is a game that feeds candy into your eyes.There's a lot to cover here but the fact that I can approach the game however I want and always talk to a friend about something in it, and realize that they had a different approach...I don't think there are many games that can even attempt that. You play most open world games and they have one way of completing something for the most part. BOTW, you can take 2-5 different ways of doing something in any given situation from enemy fights to puzzle solving.Game of the year (2017) is not enough for a game like this.

Lots of references and call-backs to previous games but I would absolutely recommend it to everyone. The game's not without its flaws however. I'm a little underwhelmed by the lack of variety in the \"shrines\" and  enemies in the open. \"Shrines\" replace the temples of yore; instead you're challenged by a large number of smaller dungeons that contain a puzzle or two or a one-on-one with a very difficult enemy. Still fun but I can't help missing the old temples. The shrines are a good challenge and the smaller format works well with the portability of the Nintendo Switch since you can take the game in little bites despite the huge overall size. Other complaints are the voice acting not being the best and also being limited just to story segments. So the latter may actually be a blessing but it's still a disappointment coming from other games. Overall it's pretty darn good and highly recommended.",

Delighted, because it still stays true to the Hylian lore, monster lore, and aesthetics, while offering an entirely new perspective on the series.

Link is flawed, full of charm, and is very expressive.The only negative I have for the game is with its voice acting. It's \"ok,\" but I really would have preferred that they opted not to include it. Some of the text sounds awkward when spoken aloud, and when adding subpar voice acting to it (when the Zelda series has never had it before), it doubles the awkwardness. Despite that, I still give the game 5 stars because of how stinkin' beautiful it is, how often I find myself laughing at the character interactions, and how it forces you to change the way you play and think.",

    "review Text": "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a pleasurable experience. It provides many hours of immersive fun and a sense of discovery that is hard to find in other games. It returns the series to its roots of discovery and exploration.  The main goal the developers kept in mind during development was to give the player a sense of childlike wonder and discovery. Eiji Aonuma, the head director, wanted players to explore and discover the world at their own pace and play it how they want to. This game appeals to everyone because of the game’s goal, which was kept in mind throughout its development. The only alienating aspect of this design is that the beginning is tough relative to the rest of the game. There is a noticeable learning curve at first, and the game doesn’t do too much to help you through it. As a result, this game can alienate people that aren’t used to playing video games, but the learning curve isn’t so unfair that it pushes players away from the game.  Open-world games launch with bugs; these bugs can either break the game or have no effect at all. Breath of the Wild is an objectively well-made game because the bugs that exist don’t prevent any mechanics from functioning. The mechanics work as intended and can be pushed to extremes. The environment has little to no visual bugs and keeps you immersed. The menus aren’t hard to navigate, and the user interface isn’t intrusive. The only major issue is that the game will occasionally drop below thirty frames-per-second in certain areas.  The game is so massive, and the mechanics have so much depth, that it’d be hard to find someone that doesn’t enjoy at least one aspect of it. This game gives a sense of freedom that not many games are able to match. The physics engine alone gives a lot more depth and variety to the game-play than one would think; it allows for creativity when handling any situation. This makes it intellectually stimulating to do simple tasks, such as traversing the world. And the game provides all the physics tools in the beginning for use throughout the entire game.  The game has quests and one hundred twenty physics-based puzzles scattered throughout the world, but the game shines best when you are immersed in its exploration and discovery. The content is the reward for exploring the world. It strikes a great balance between exploration and content because of this.  The game isn’t perfect though. The story is generic and leaves much to be desired, and much of its content is shallow. Despite these negatives though, the foundation of the game is so well-made, that it is still fun. When I go back to replay this game, I don’t play it for the story or the quests, I play it for the world and its mechanics. This game succeeds in its goal to give everyone that sense of discovery that the series was originally founded upon.",

As an artist, I notice the little things and everything from the ambient noises, to the splash effects on objects during rainfall are so well done. Not only that, the overall gameplay is outstanding. There is no linearity to this game which I really enjoy. You can tackle pretty much any of the main quests in any order you want (though I've learned there is definitely a suggested order). The world is huge, I've spent well over 70+ hours in game and I've probably only seen 25% of the map. The side quests can keep you tied over for a long, long time.This game is definitely a challenge as well. There are quite a few complex (and somewhat irritating) puzzles, riddles to solve, and beefy baddies that want to mount your head on their wall. This game will make you put that brain to use, allowing you to formulate plans to reach a sometimes unclear path to your destination. Temples have been replaced by the \"Devine Beasts\" as well as sub-dungeons (shrines); I dig the concept. Weapon durability sucks but, that's part of the experience.

    "review Text": "The only other Zelda game I have ever played is A Link To The Past, so I am reviewing this as a game, not as a \"Zelda game.\" I don't know where the series has gone in the 20 years since I last played A Link To The Past so I can't make comparisons.That said, in the first ten hours of gameplay, I would have given this game five stars, but now that I am about halfway finished, I have to settle upon about three stars. The game starts out feeling very epic and vast, to the point where you will probably feel overwhelmed. After the introductory area is complete, the Great Plateau, you are free to go anywhere, any direction you want. You won't realize it at first, but that's because there's no real character advancement in this game, and the enemy diversity is basically non-existent. You will most likely follow the directions to the quest you are immediately given to find an elder in a village, rather than going in the complete opposite direction to explore, because you will think not straying from the quest will keep you in the safe areas of the game world for your level and skill range, but in fact there are no dangerous areas. There are only about four types of general enemies in this game and you will be able to defeat them all from the very start of the game. There are another one or two enemies that are kind of like mini-bosses but they are extremely rare and easily avoidable if you do find them before you have enough hearts to engage. So yeah you can explore anywhere you want right from the start, the problem is that after several regions worth of exploration, you're going to start noticing that you've never found anything new. It's end game and you're still fighting the same bokoblins you encountered in the first region you were ever in.You can explore everywhere. Climb every mountain, search high and low, because the game does reward exploration. But there's only three things to find. A shrine, a treasure chest, or a korok seed. Treasure chests and korok seeds aren't particularly exciting, but shrines will be, until you've done about 20 of them. At this point when I find a shrine I just approach it so I can get the fast travel point for it and then I leave because I just can't be arsed to do any more. Shrines lead you to a puzzle to solve, and they are initially fun and make you feel kinda smart when you've solved it, but it gets repetitive.Plotwise, there is noooooo plot. Seriously, none. Spoiler alert, I'm about to tell you the entire game in the next three sentences. Your first main quest is to go speak to an elder in a certain village. Once there, you learn Zelda is fighting Ganon at Hyrule Castle and you need to go help her fight. Before you do that, you should go cleanse four currently corrupt machines to get them to help you when you go do the Ganon fight. I'm not kidding, that's it, that's the whole deal. The four machines that need to be cleansed function as the game's \"dungeons\" (they are giant structures). When you arrive, you solve some puzzles inside them, and then there will be a mini-boss to kill to cleanse the corruption. That's pretty much it. I've done two of them thus far, they actually are fun to do but really only take 30-60 minutes to complete.There are other quests in the game, given to you by villagers mostly, but so far they have all been directions to a shrine in the form of a riddle, fetch quests (\"fetch me ten grasshoppers to make the bargirl love me\"), or kill quests (\"kill those moblins over there for me\"). Nothing interesting to make up for the lack of a real main quest.The game is very beautiful, despite the graphical quality not being as good as PC, PS4 or Xbox One. Unfortunately, it rains all the time, obscuring your view, so you will rarely be able to admire the scenery. Terrible developer choice there.So that's my review. I do recommend the game. It's fun to play, and the gameplay is very clever. I'm still finding out new things it's possible to \"do\" in this game, i.e. I just learned you can feed dogs and they will lead you to a treasure box. It's the kind of game where you should really try anything that pops into your brain that just miiiiight be possible to do, because there's a good chance the developers are ten steps ahead of you and actually did make that possible. If they would have added enough actual content to the game, it could have been a masterpiece, but as the game currently stands, it's just a big sandbox to explore, and not much else.",

I played a bit of Windwaker and Majora's Mask, but never got into them like the others. I can say for certainty that Breath of the Wild is my favorite game in the franchise.I've read some 1 star reviews and all of them sound as if they either only played 30 mins of the game or they dont understand the concept. This is a survival game (you have to follow the story to understand why). Because of this, things break, you have to make food to sustain yourself. You will be pitted against foes that seem almost impossible to defeat, except Ganon who is pretty easy if you wait a good while to fight him (a bit after getting the Master Sword), but you wait until you find that better gear and you've made better food and potions. Then you can fight a Silver Lynel and get its ingredients and gear and bask in the glory of victory against the most difficult enemy in the game. Its very rewarding once you've figured out the flow of the game.Someone was complaining about horses and how \"useless\" they are when you're adventuring and get too far to whistle for it. Horses are for getting to towers. Towers are used to travel to areas you havent been. You can literally teleport to any found tower from anywhere then glide across the map.Also, the controls are great. I played on the Wii U with zero trouble. It is a little different than previous games but oh well, get used to it. They are seriously not that bad. One piece of advise for new players, don't try to swim very much. You will drown. Use the ice pillar spell (can't remember the name) and jump across the water. Waaay easier and much faster. That was actually the one thing that kept my brother from playing it. He has zero patience with figuring things out.If I had one point to put across it would be to give it a chance. Don't just turn it down because it's different from previous Zelda games.

The game from the get go wow's you with its world, the land of Hyrule is staggeringly massive and has hundreds of hours of story, activities, side quests, missions, puzzles to complete! The game is brimming at the seams full of content and the sheer amount of what you can do is mind blowing! Yes Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, Fallout 3 and 4, Witcher 3, Red Dead Redemption, Grand Theft Auto 5, Metal Gear Solid 5 and so many other open world games have worlds as big or even bigger than BOTW Hyrule but never has a game to me been able to evoke the feeling of exploration and adventure as well as Zelda's Hyrule has! I've sunk hours into this game completed countless quests and missions, even found all the memories and master sword to get the perfect ending and even with all that done I've yet to scratch the surface of this game (17.86 percent of 100 to be exact).....and this is where Breath of the Wild shines! This is a world that even with all the games coming out this year and next I'll still want to explore to find that one last shrine or one extra korok seed, or that one mission to help so and so do this.....the charm and wonderment of the Zelda universe has hooked me once again and I do want to one day 100 percent this game, but in the mean time I'm enjoying everything at my own pace=) The game deserves all the praise it's received and is hands down a masterpiece and the fresh breath game that Nintendo so desperately needed!

However I have to be honest here and say that’s it’s also got a ton of similarities to every other modern open world rpg out there. The side quests consist of collecting items or finding treasure. The way to expand your inventory slots is to collect hidden Korok seeds. The puzzles add some depth though.",

Or you can try to do every single quest, find every single Korok seed (good luck), and pass every single shrine's test on the way to defeating Ganon. Or you can speedrun it, and kill a Lynel with your starting three hearts and some tree branches.My only negative comment is that the gender representation and narrative is pretty poorly done, and socially regressive.",

    "review Text": "The only other Zelda game i've ever played and completed was The Legend of Zelda Twlight Princess (it's a good game too!) so my review is based on the comparison of that game and legend of zelda BOTW. If you have a wiiU this game is definitely worth getting, but I would NOT buy a switch just for this game. The only reason I did was because I found more than three other games including this one(I am Setsuna which is also on PS4 I think, Mario kart, Disgaea 5, and Rime) that I wouldn’t mind playing on the switch that are available now before all the really good ones set to be released near november. I like that it has a huge open world much bigger than the world of twlight princess, but i feel they ran out of things to put in it besides shrines and the occasional group of monsters or mini bosses which i think hindered its full potential. Instead I feel they should have added puzzles/challenges for each section of this huge world to make the player work for entry into each region. There was only one area of the map that I can think of right now where you were forced to find a single entrance and not just fly or climb right into it and really WORK to find your way through the area. THIS should have been done to all regions of the map to challenge the player even more and possibly provide more background to the story. For example, “Because this happened, it caused this to happen which stopped this from happening in/with our village so solve this then we will let you into our village and tell you the origins of this problem passed down from our ancestors so you can start your journey to solving the original cause of the problem�? As it is now you can just walk right into a new area/region/village with no real mind-boggling challenge and perform the steps needed to enter the dungeon. With twilight princess before helping anyone you had to first prove yourself worthy to even enter/save the village before starting the journey into the dungeon. The repetition in the monsters that were not bosses and what rewards were given after their defeat was not good considering the rewards were not worth it 50% of the time. I get that based on the name ”Wild�?you’re supposed to fend for yourself like a cave man, but in some aspects of the game-play it contradicts its title by in fact giving you stuff. Compared to Twlight Princess, these \"dungeons\" (I'm not sure if i would call them that) in BOTW were not as lengthy (which I liked the lengthy dungeons from twilight princess) and the puzzles in the dungeon were not as challenging. I have not beaten all the bosses but so far the bosses of these “dungeons�?are not as difficult as I had hoped, except for one took me a second try to defeat but I still wish they were a bit harder or required a longer time to defeat. I am not a hardcore gamer or hardcore zelda fan just FYI but this is one of the main reason I refrain from beating all the bosses because if they are not hard enough I will finish the game too quickly, and considering there are not many games out for switch yet I want to avoid that. The puzzle level of difficulty for the shrines  was almost the same level as the “Dungeon’s puzzle�?which is not good. You want to differentiate between the two considering there are over 100 shrines and you don’t want to do the same puzzle or one that is similar a 100 times. There are too many side quests in the game which would not have been a bad thing if the rewards were better, but I am forced to do them to avoid finishing the game too quickly. The graphics I was hoping to be more realistic and well-defined like twilight princess but they are more cartoon-ish but it’s ok. I am really trying to keep from spoiling the game but at the end of the day It’s a good game, I don’t want to score based on a 1-10 scale because people will blow up the comments with “Why I’m wrong and they’re right�?speeches but just know if this is the only game you’re interested in playing on the switch until other games come out towards the end of the year just wait until then or get it for the wiiU. As a programmer (but not a video game programmer) i try not to be harsh on the development team but with the size of this map i feel that if they combined the aspect of entry into villages from twlight princess with the enormous open world concept of BOTW this would have reached a whole other level, stretched out the game-play time a little longer, and left room to possibly provide more background to the story.",

I have Zelda stickers on my car, a  LOZ tattoo on my wrist, and I have beaten nearly all of them at least once (my favorites at least twice), and my son has followed in Mom's geekariffic footsteps in the tradition of loving and playing the games.  Ok.  Sooo.This is a great game.  It's ambitious, takes a lot of patience and it's adventuresome.  The graphics and world size are completely off the charts amazing, and it has many of the classic Zelda elements (in the character & enemy elements) we have come to know and love.That having been said, after playing the game enough to have solved 99 shrines so far, found 300 Koroks (I'm the kind of person who has to complete EVERYTHING before beating the game, so it'll still be quite a while...I'm only about half done)...I like it, but Twilight Princess is still my favorite game.  I LOVE how huge and beautiful and seemingly limitless this game is.  They really perfected every last thing about it before they released it.  Every adventure-game lover MUST play this game to completion, as it is beautiful and fun.  For the total Zelda geek though, it's lacking a few super important elements...Cons:  there is hardly any music ever to be heard.  I understand the need for quiet much of the time, but it would be amazing if we could have a choice to turn on music or not in the background or something, at least at times.  We Zelda fans have been spoiled with the beautiful melodies that infuse the games, and this one is sorely lacking in that department.  We're teased with a tidbit of beautiful tune faintly here and there, and there's in-village music, but ya know...not the same.  There are NO temples.  That's right...NONE.  The game broke the record for largest game world, without having one single temple.  This absolutely broke my heart.  All this expansive land and sea, and no temples to find, explore or solve at all.  What it does have, however, are small shrines.  These usually require solving a simple to complex puzzle or feat of strength to complete, and all include at least one treasure and one item that you can use to collect and exchange for upgrading your hearts OR your stamina gauge.  You cannot go under water.  It makes sense, as this world-record world size would almost literally never end if it was equally as expansive to explore under water as it is above ground, but it's still a bummer.  We've been diving under water since OOT back in the '90s, so of course we Zelda geeks want to dive down and explore...especially with these spectacular graphics!  The rewards for most of the sidequests are mostly inconsequential - rupees or materials - no matter how hard you worked for them.Pros - you can choose how to upgrade your character as you go.  You can cook foods and elixirs with what you find, making concoctions that do all sorts of beneficial things.  You can do anything or go anywhere in any order.  The game is beautifully laid out, and very well planned.  There are different, cool puzzles to solve in the game.  You can upgrade your weapon stash spots, the more Koroks you find.  You can run, glide, check horses in and out of stables, warp, interact with characters in traditional LOZ fashion, and even collect and dye clothing that has its own benefits and protections as well! You can mark your map with up to 100 stamps (I have used about 90 of them, had to delete some), you can place beacons on the map and when you zoom in to scope.  You can climb literally ANY outdoor surface in the game. The game really is a LOT of fun if you're an adventure-explore person.  You've gotta try it.  When you obtain a new objective, you can look it up, see the details of it, and even place a map beacon of it on the map to remind you where it started.I hope this helps.  No matter what, everyone really should own this game.  💚",

I got excited to play in Master Mode after winning the game once through, and quit after my first monster fight.  It's no fun to fight monsters that spontaneously heal.  It's a cheat, not a game.  Why not just give them more HP or let them eat to restore some health, if they have a second?That said, this is definitely a winner overall.  Gorgeous, inspired, and tons of fun to explore.

    "review Text": "This was THE game everyone was anticipating in 2017. When was the last time we had a console Zelda game? Back in November 2011 we got Skyward Sword. Since then, what has happened? Well six years have passed. That’s a LONG LONG time. During that time, the Wii died, the Wii U launched and died and the Switch launched. We went though three Nintendo consoles. Sheesh Nintendo, could you take any longer?Story 4/10The story in this game in minimal at best. Sure Zelda games aren’t know for their stories but they sure were entertaining in past entries. The doomsday apocalypse style plot from Majoras Mask, or the LOTR style epic tale of Twilight Princess, and even the epic save the girl from certain doom Skyward Sword, it was all entertaining to me. Well than what happened here? Let me explain it. The basic premise is this: Link wakes up in a secret chamber after a 100 years. He finds out the Hyrule is in ruins and must stop “Calamity Ganon�?from completing devastating Hyrule by getting help from the four champions. Sound great right? But there is absolutely no meat to it. There are very few cutscenes throughout the game that explain the story. But to see these scenes, you have to go around Hyrule and find something called “Memories�?which trigger the cutscenes. You can get them in any order, so you may not exactly understand what happens unless you watch them in order. These “Memories�?usually are like 1 minute to 2 minutes long and don’t really explain much. As for the four champions, guess what? They are dead. The only way to see them is through those “Memories�?cutscenes. Since those cutscenes are so short, no champion is given much air time to flesh out. You have four champions: Daruk the Goran, the all brawn and no brains type of guy. Lady Urbosa: The buff, strong and independent women that panders to SWJs�? You have Mipha: The Zora Princess who is your typical Mary Sue. Next you have Revali: the arrogant Ruto. Lastly you have Princess Zelda who has the personality of a card board box. It really is a shame. All these characters were voiced and there was a lot of potential to flesh them out and have them more involved in the plot but that didn’t happen. You just go around and save their spirits and they give you a special ability. That’s about as much of a contribution they have in the story. Now lets talk about Ganon. Ganon does not even speak a single word in the game, and that is a damn shame. Compared to Demise and Ghiriham, Calamity Ganon is nothing. He doesn’t even feel threating. Heck the game doesn’t even explain what his motives are, what he wants to achieve, or what are his plans. Nada. Zilch. That disappoints me in so many ways, it cant even be helped.Graphics/Performance 7/10Ok. Enough ranting about the story, lets talk about the graphics. I personally don’t like the cell shaded graphics. Never have, never will. I prefer the Ocarina of Time/Twilight Princess Style much better. But what is here is very nice. And these graphics will age much better than say the more realistic style Zelda games. The world is nice, lush, colorful and full of detail. You can use your telescope to see far away locations in great detail, and the draw distance is very nice. HOWEVER. The performance is not very good at all. The framerate stays at around 30FPS but can sometimes dip into the mid 20s. What I hated was that during intense battle, the entire game would just lock up for a split second. That would be jarring. You can really tell this game is really taxing the Wii U.Controls 8/10Well what can I say? The controls are nice, tight and responsive. Not much for me to criticize. But what I found surprising was the lack of use of the Wii U gamepad. Seriously, it was used for nothing other than gyroscopic aiming. No quick switching inventory, no mini-map, no quick weapons. Nothing. That was a disappointment seriously. You make an entire console around the gamepad and tout its abilities and features but don’t use it on your flagship game? Not cool. Felt like Nintendo gave up on the Wii U long before we did.Audio 6/10There really isn’t much music in this game. What you get in this game is more like ambient sounds and a few chimes here and there. It gives like an “empty�?or “deserted�?like feel. I guess that is true since there Hyrule is in ruins. You also have music for specific areas such as the Goron Village, Kakariko Village, Zoras Domain, and Ruto Village but its nothing rememberal really. Remember the epic “Ballad of the Godess�?main theme from Skyward Sword? Yeah, you won’t find anything like that here.GameplayNow! Lets get to the heart of this game: The gameplay. Since gameplay has so many different aspects to it, I’m going to divide this section up.Combat 9/10Man I loved the combat in this game. Its like a dumbed downed Dark Souls. You will die a lot in this game. Make no mistake about it. Even the smallest groups of enemies bring the threat of death. When engaged in a battle, you must use your head. Gone is the stale Z-targeting your enemies and slashing away easy combat. In this game, Link can carry a wide variety of weapons. You can usually find many different types of spears, sword, bows, hammers and stick all around the world. Each is unique and deals different damage to the enemy. You also have bombs, a push and pull magnetic ability, arrows, and a shield. You have to use these weapons to cleveraly defeat the enemy. The bad part is that these weapons break really fast. Which sucks. I cant go around swinging that cool sword I got, I have to save it for the big boss battle. But still, it brings a challenging new dynamic combat system that actually engages you and leaves the casuals behind.Exploration 4/10Nintendo gives this huge world to explore. But there is nothing to do in it. Here is how it works. You have this huge expansive man to explore, but most of it is dark until you go to certain area. Usually it is divided by provinces. Once you cross into that province, it automatically appears lighted up on your map. It’s a nice world, but there is nothing in it. When compared to a game such as Skyrim. Skyrim has a huge world as well. But its world is filled with tons of cities, town, and villages. There are entire chains of story quests and interesting side characters to interact with. It makes it feel like a real world. In BOTW you got almost none of that. There are barely any villages except for a few, and they carry almost nothing interesting in them. There are no interesting side quests, stories or interesting characters to make it worth your time. Its beautiful empty world. The only thing there is do are the shrines. These shrines are what you call “Mini-dungeons�? Each has the same theme, music and environment but a different sort of puzzle. The rewards of completing these shrines are special orbs. You can trade these ords in at the ruined temple of time to increase your health or stamina but the really is about it. There are other things such as collecting korok seeds but that has no substance. Coming from open world games such as Skyrim, Oblivion, The Witcher 3, Fallout 4, an Dragon Age. This is a colossal disappointment. Whatever happened to the interesting and crazy sidequests from Majoras Mask? We definitely could have used them here! What I suggest Nintendo do for the next game is that definitely have an open world but put more meat to it. Have a tons of different large cities with a ton of interactive NPCS. Have a ton of different sidequest that are entertaining and memorable and give you a reason to explore the vast world.Dungeons 2/10Sorry fam, this is another disappointment. Remember the complex and crazy dungeons from Twilight princess or Skyward Sword? Yeah? Well they aint here. Sucks. What you have here are Divine Beasts. You go inside these structures and they are pretty small. They have a few clever puzzles but that’s about it. On top of that, the boss fights are disappointing in this game. They are just four different variations of Calamity Ganon. Nothing creative. Remember that sunken ship and the squid boss from Skyward sword where you had to alter time to get around the dungeon? You wont get anything like that here. Extremely Sad.ConclusionI felt like something turbulent was going on at Nintendo during the Wii U Era. Its no surprise, the system was a failure. In this game got delayed many times. I feel like they created a nice open world and a very good combat system but didn’t have the time to add any substance in this world they created. I hope in the next game they can add more to it. Its like an ocean that’s an inch deep.Final Score6/10",

The puzzles are spread about as shrines and each shrine has a tiny amount of puzzles. Even the main dungeons are only medium-sized shrines, which means tiny temples.- The rain arbitrarily hinders your progress, making it near impossible to complete the task you're trying to do until waiting out the rain.- Weapons break all the time. It's at the point where I don't WANT to use my powerful weapons because they'll break after I attack a few moblins I run into and won't have them ready for when I need them.- Way too much grinding.

Needless to say I'm a huge fan of the franchise. I've played Zelda games in every decade of my life and honestly I've enjoyed all of them including the Wind Waker. The only reason I bought a switch was for breath of the Wild. When I first started playing this game there wasn't much about it I liked, however I kept playing thinking it would get better, and it certainly did get better. It's not a bad game at all but it's really not what I expected from a Zelda game. The classic multiple dungeon puzzle solving is really non-existent in this game, with the exception of four Divine beasts dungeons, which are incredibly simple to solve. There is nothing incredibly challenging about this game other than some extremely difficult combat . Compared to other Zelda games the bosses and mini-bosses are fairly boring and the difficulty comes more from having the correct gear  and weapons rather than learming the fighrs. What I was most disappointed in the  constant need for cooking meals to counter environental conditions. The idea that you have to make elixirs to keep you warm so you can travel through the mountains is just not something that's fun , in fact it becomes really annoying. the destructible weapons are a horrible idea. It's a decent game, it won't change your life , and it's certainly not a great game, and probably my least favorite of all of the Zelda games.",

Speaking if which, I believe there are 100 total shrines to be found, each with its own puzzles and rewards.  Traditional dungeons aren't completely dead though.  There are 4 \"Divine Beast\" dungeons that must be completed as part of the main quest.Overall, this is a fresh experience for a 30-year veteran of the series.

It's has been the most disappointing and possible worst game I played in 2017.Open world games, RPGs, fantasy story-telling, these are the things my gaming catalogue is made of, i have some sports in there, the odd FPS, but generally speaking this game SHOULD have been my bread and butter, it wasn't, the world doesn't make sense or feel real, the combat is built for fighting individuals but routinely has you fighting groups of enemies, the puzzles were fun at first but quickly started running out of new ideas and often just introduced things you would never think of (like hitting a boulder with an arrow to roll it, my bad for not immediately assuming a large heavy rock could be so easily swayed by a tiny piece of metal on a bending stick). I hate the weapon breaking mechanic, whomever thought of it needs to stop making games and start thinking about a career in water torture applications. The characters in the game are boring or much like the world they inhabit just don't feel real the way they're presented, now understand by real i don't mean \"realistic\" like a modern batman movie, but the world doesn't work, the world is almost completely empty apart from occasional enemies, and yet when you find settlements people seem to be living very normal unhampered lives, one guy has even opened up a clothes dying store, these are not the villages of a world under siege by the forces of evil. They talk about how the world is filled with monsters attacking everybody, and yet there's inns and stables just sitting between some trees, 200 years from an enemy camp, protected by a guy looking for recipes and someone cooking an apple.

If not, skip this game, it's full of that.Do you like spending large amounts of time crafting food to heal because hearts don't drop from enemies? If not, skip this game.Do you like horses that randomly wander away from where you're guiding them, no matter how well you train them? What about shields that break after a few hits, or bows that break after a few shots? How about every enemy in the game one or two-shotting you, especially at the beginning? Even the weakest enemies? And they only drop body parts that you can maybe craft into an elixer, or sell for a few rupees if you happen upon a vendor?Do you want to spend 90% of your time roaming around picking up things off the ground, 9% of the time loading from dying, and the other 1% of the time marveling at how beautiful the game is, even if it's not a Legend of Zelda game? Well, this is your game.If you like finding equipment to get more powerful, dungeons with creative traps and puzzles, cool boss battles, and you know, what actually people think of when they think of a Legend of Zelda game? Skip this.Despite all the great reviews, this is a terrible Zelda game. And, if like me, you hate crafting, hate weapon duration (particularly when it's extremely low) and hate long periods of time either loading for fast travel (and it loads slowly) or walking or fighting your horse constantly, you will HATE this game. In my mind, it is objectively terrible, and the worst Zelda game ever made.I did not buy this game on Amazon. I bought a switch, just to play this game. I regret everything. Don't be like me. Be smart. Wait for a real Zelda game. \"Open World Zelda\" is terrible. Worse, it wouldn't take much to turn it from the turd of a game it is into a true gem, and all of that is to take out the frustration that's put into the game to make it drag out, and replace it with things that make a Zelda game into a Zelda game. The boomerang? That shouldn't be a breakable weapon, it should be a tool. There should be a hookshot.I do like the idea of the sheikah slate, the map, and for a console, the fast travel load times are almost bearable, except that you have to do it so often. People will say there's something everywhere for you to do. What they mean is you can pick a mushroom, or an apple, or catch a frog, or something else that's unimportant. Sure, there are lots of shrines, which are like tiny dungeons with one puzzle or one, sometimes ridiculously overpowered, enemy. There's no linearity to the game, so you don't know if you're going the right direction or if the shrine will be possible for you to solve, but you can guess that your first 10 to 20 HOURS will be spent frustrated before you get to the first 'dungeon', which is too short and too easy by comparison.There's a lot of tech demoed in the game, and it's interesting. You can 'slide' down mountains on your shield, if you don't mind ripping it apart to do it. You have to go around collecting things to trade for inventory slots so you can carry 5 crappy swords, so you can get through a decent amount of combat, because EVERYTHING BREAKS IN THIS GAME TOO QUICKLY. It's pointless time wasting to pad the game length, because there isn't much REAL game here.I beg you, do your own research. Watch gameplay videos. If you like crafting games and constantly picking up apples and acorns to cook, 5 at a time when you may have 50, then you might enjoy this. I think you might be too easily entertained, but this game was made for you.If you like the Legend of Zelda series, this game is not. It feels like a different game with the theme tacked on.",

    "review Text": "What happened to The legend of Zelda?, I waited for this game, i really wanted it, I grew up with all the zelda's and played every single one of them, Ocarina of time marked me for life and Majora's mask gave me reason's to play over and over, Twilight princess was just phenomenal, skyward sword and wind waker were a joy to play and complete.Before I begin, please know that based on the above, I'm a huge Zelda fan, in my opinion, it's zelda not mario, the one franchise that has been carrying Nintendo forward for the past 20 years. It launched with the Wii, and it became the best selling console, it didn't launch with the wii U and it was a disaster (even though the console itself was a very nice concept), and now it launched with the Switch and the numbers are promising.Where should I start? I really wanted to like this game. As soon as I started playing it, I was extremely excited about it, I looked like a kid all over again, everyone in the house was engaged watching me play, and my kids were upset that they were not playing.it quickly became a revelation that this game was promised to be something amazing but it's not. The concept of being open world it's nice. it's different, it changes things, but it wasn't necessary. You find yourself running and running, discovering things, yes!!, climbing and finding new places, yes!! that's great, but it takes you twice as long since they decide to make it open world but limit the amount of sprint and climbing distance with a stamina bar.... which doesn't last very long. Yes you can upgrade it overtime, but it's stupid to begin with and should have never been there.Weapons. Break. All. The. Time! every single battle, be prepared to pause your game and grab another weapon, or do it from the quick menu, but just be ready to switch or find more weapons, I thought this was the hero of time... more like a waste of time.Which brings me to my next point, the display when you select your weapons it's a mess. the layout it's horrible, The tunics that you get are dispersed so you constantly have to try to figure out which one it's which, because they are not organized automatically, same with the weapons and the special items, meaning whatever you get first would be displayed in small boxes one next to the other, in comparison to the ocarina of time, where all the medallions were in a circle when you pressed start, or the triforce were organized in a triangle. everything made sense.Which brings me to my next point. WHERE IS THE TRIFORCE???? never even mentioned. disappointing, it was the core of all the zelda games.there are only FOUR dungeons, which by the way, my 6 year old can complete them without looking, you basically walk in a straight line, activate the small shrines in the dungeon and that's it, for all four. not difficult at all, gone are the days, were you had to open doors, get keys, solve puzzles, fight mini-bosses, get items, get maps, get a new weapon. GONE, dungeons are not longer dungeons, they are more like a checkpoint. extremely disappointing.The Master Sword, worse sword in the game btw, do not be fooled by the previous experiences you've had with zelda games, it has a energy bar as well, you can fight with it, but it will stop working once the energy is low and it will have to recharge......... I thought this was the Master sword.....and it's extremely easy to get. all you have to do is walk over to it and pick it up, considering you have hearts, that's all it is. Comparing this to let's say Ocarina of time, where you have to get three pieces of the triforce, an ocarina, a song, etc. can't believe I'm writing this review. So upsetting.Where are the songs, the musical instruments, the cool gadgets?? oh that's right you get a camera......... to take pictures of animals.... and plants.... and enemies which are probably 4 of them in total... not including the guardians.So everyone talks in the game... be ready for that, at first i was confused, then it grew on me, but then it gets irritating knowing that Link doesn't say a single word. he just stares at the other characters with no emotion.Link runs extremely weird, and they added a retarded sweat animation when he runs which it's completely unnecessary. Why Nintendo?? why???Ganon can be killed in about 2 minutes, so don't get your hopes up for a good match that will keep you coming back for more.I'm sure i've missed more things, but overall, that's the game, the map is huge and it had so much potential to be a great masterpiece, but it's not guys, let's clear that up, you will see a lot of people giving it that title and putting 5 star reviews, some of those are paid by nintendo last i heard, but the others are really hardcore zelda fans that love the game regardless for what it is, I was one of those, but i honestly couldn't take it anymore, I had to write a review, I had to let my voice be heard. it's extremely upsetting, to know that there are many things that just ruin the game.Sorry to those fans that might get upset over this or think that I'm crazy. Believe me, I wanted this to be the greatest game ever.PS: on Wii U the game will lag horribly, it's almost unplayable, it might be better on switch, but still the same game. horrible experience.",

    "review Text": "It is sad but this game is now evil. This game has some spiritualistic undertones for example Demon ruler, god you pray to, spirits, resurrection etc. I can't believe Nintendo ruined this fantasy series by taking it down this path. None of the prior games were like this at all. The thing is none of this was needed to make the game great. The game would have been great had they stuck to Zelda traditions of the triforce and defeating Ganon.Now Ganon is a \"Demon\" and the King (Zelda's father) is a sprit, Link died in a battle long-ago and was resurrected. You gain spirit orbs from evil looking statues and have to pray to some god to gain hearts. I am sure there is worse as  most of this content is revealed shortly after you make initial progress and gain the \"paraglider\".I am saddened Nintendo ruined such a great series by adding all these unneeded spiritualistic themes/content to what is supposed to be a game safe for kids. I expect the sword fighting and fantasy monsters/enemies, but what me and my kids saw was inappropriate for kids - Everything about this game screams evil.All this qualifies as a \"Teen\" game under the suggestive theme content as per below:TEEN\"Content is generally suitable for ages 13 and up. May contain violence, suggestive themes, crude humor, minimal blood, simulated gambling and/or infrequent use of strong language.\"Had this been a Teen game, many people don't buy it for their kids (like me) and I know Nintendo knew this... I am appalled at this oversight by the ESRB (look at their game description) and Nintendo hiding this content....As it stands both my kids ask me about the game being evil....You have all been warned.As for content, I figured I give those who don't care about the spiritualistic side something to think about:1. This game has not been polished, there are technical issues/glitches and gameplay frustrations that show poor quality control. For example, you are given meaningless tasks that are intended as filler for time such as having to create a specific dish and figure out the last ingredient required from your 1 million food items picked up. It gets better though, one of the ingredients for that dish you can only get by hunting an animal that produces two steaks per kill. The best part is there is only one animal (Bison?) that shows up in one location randomly which is fairly large and you have to explore to find (because that is totally realistic that only one would appear). The point is the task is made a difficult as possible and fills like a plot to get you to waste time.It gets better, some mountains that you can climb up you will randomly fall off from even if you still have stamina. Also, the bisons I spoke of earlier (that you must hunt) will disappear if chased even in an open field (enemies will also stop following after a while). All these screams poor game design.2. These random tasks get become frustrating as you have to figure out things on your own with very minimal hints. I suspect a group of people will get bored and stop playing here.3. The dungeons take like 5 minutes to compete and don't have more than one basic puzzle to solve. It is actually more difficult to find the dungeons than to spend the 5 minutes to clear them.4. The combat is basic and you will not die fighting until you fight some mini-boss type of character in the open field that kills you with one hit, of course since enemies have no intelligence, the game would be too easy without this cheapness.5. While supposedly a huge game there is very little to directly interact with that serves any gameplay purpose other than to waste time - the producers of the games could have focused development on the inhabitants of this world rather than making everything so random.Now you can decide if this game is worth your money based on these issues.",

I played all the Zelda games on all the different platforms. This Zelda game is beyond anything I ever played and I can't stop playing it.  The land is so big sometimes I play just to roam around and spend hours just having fun with no objective in mind.  I've even played just to ride a horse from one stable to another it crazy.  I started playing in December and I play ever day and just the other day I discovered a hidden temple which had me say OMG I thought I been ever where.  There's 120 shrines to find I've found 96 and there are lots of side quests to complete.  I highly recommend this game and hope to see the Zelda Breath of Wind 2 that is rumor to be released soon.When you first start out you have a small area to explore and learn the game once you leave that area you look for towers that will give you parts of the map. So there the map to complete, shires to find and solve, side quests to do for people plus the real game defeat 4 guardians and then the clear the castle and defeat Ganon.If anyone knows of a game like Zelda that I need to play please leave a comment.",

    "review Text": "I really wanted to like this game, but it's got ENORMOUS flaws that make it completely unenjoyable for me.First and most glaringly, the combat would be excellent if you didn't have to shuffle around and get out a new weapon every four or five seconds. Perfect dodging is really fun, it is! ...Or at least it WOULD BE if the counterattack combo that you get when you do it didn't break your weapon 90% of the time. To fix this, they really should increase the durability of the weapons or make at least some of them unbreakable. Another problem with the combat is that I have to pause and eat something every time I get hit because EVERY ENEMY (even the bokoblins!!) can take you down to 1/4 of a heart in a single hit (which kind of eliminates the purpose of a health meter).  This wouldn't be such a freaking problem if your shield didn't break every time you use it. Again, I'm okay with weapon breaking, but I shouldn't have to go through several weapons in ONE encounter.Second, yes the world is big and full of secrets, BUT the only rewards you ever get for exploring or fighting are extremely breakable weapons and spirit orbs. I find myself skipping parts because what's the point? all I'm going to get is a lousy weapon, and I don't even have any space in my inventory. Also, the world is so big that it's got TONS of empty space. If you're like me and you only get an hour here or there to play every few days, then you'll NEVER get anything done. I once wasted a whole play session because I needed to go back and get something from the town I just left. The round trip (on horseback!) took a real life hour because I hadn't unlocked fast traveling yet. They really should condense everything into a smaller map and give more meaningful rewards for exploring other than a weapon you're just going to break or throw away, or a spirit orb that you can get at any of 200+ shrines....which segues into my third point, the shrines are all very VERY forgettable. I don't remember the name of a single one. I've never been one to skip cutscenes before, but the fact that they try to make each shrine seem important by showing you the same cutscene every time you enter seems pretentious to me. Now, I'm a little bit of a completionist--I don't feel like I've beaten a game if I've left any quests undone, but I find myself skipping the shrines that I don't like, which makes me feel a little dead inside each time I do it. Why break all my weapons fighting yet another robot guardian in the <insert name here> shrine? All I'm getting out of it is a lousy spirit orb, and I can just go to the shrine next door and drop balls into baskets for one. They could at least have made all the shrines in each region have a similar theme, or maybe mixed up the guardians so they look different, or maybe made the sages at the end all the same recurring character instead of 200 forgettable ones....And I really don't like the puzzles they have in these shrines either, which is a huge shame because the puzzles are my favorite part of any Zelda game! In designing the puzzles so that you can solve them using just ANYTHING, I always feel like I'm cheating my way through them. My girlfriend played through before me and showed me how she can just flip the controller over and cheese her way through the ball-maze puzzles, but DAGNABBIT I WANTED TO DO THEM LEGIT for my playthrough... except after getting the ball through the maze about a dozen times the right way and still not being able to get it into the basket at the end because of wonky controls I just cheated... and felt empty inside because of it. All for a lousy spirit orb, too. I dunno, I constantly found myself getting frustrated with a number of puzzles because I knew what needed to be done but it wasn't working right. (I guess this particular point is half-ranting about how sensitive the controls are, which is murder once joycon drift starts.)Then there's the cooking. Why do they make you dive through your inventory every time you cook the same meal? Then you only cook one meal at a time? Then you have to watch it cook (skipping shaves no time off the waiting period) every time? For something that you have to do ALL THE FREAKING TIME, they sure went out of their way to make it as tedious as possible. Really, they should let you say \"I want to cook X amount of meals using ingredients Y and Z,\" then push the button ONCE and give it to you. The game's already long enough as it is for Pete's sake.Anyway, I could keep going on and on (especially about the voice acting), but really the bottom line is that no, this game isn't as perfect as everybody says, but it does do a lot of things ALMOST right. The biggest problem with it is that it's extremely tedious when it really doesn't have to be--you're constantly changing weapons, you're constantly pausing to eat, you have to travel a million miles to get anyplace, the rewards are meaningless, all the shrines are the same, it takes forever to cook, when it rains you have to unequip all metal gear, you have to wait for it to stop raining to climb, etc, etc, etc. WHY OH WHY put so much unfun crap into a game when it doesn't add any enrichment??...and why does everyone keep going on about how gorgeous a game it is? It's nowhere near as fun to look at as Okami, Last Guardian, Journey, Odin Sphere, DQVIII, FFX, or even other Zelda games, like Skyward Sword, Twilight Princess, or Windwaker. ...At least that's my humble opinion. I dunno, I'll be the first to admit I have crappy taste.",

The amount of care and effort that has gone into this game is very evident from all the fun that you can have.This game goes back to the roots of the first Zelda on the NES, and lets you loose in a vast open world (after completing a tutorial-like section). A lot of the story is implied, not said out loud. As such there aren't many talking characters but the few cut-scenes are a joy to watch.The game looks fantastic even in portable mode, and the new art style for this game adds another layer of charm to this game.This game is slightly challenging however, as the enemies you face always scale up to you and inventory management becomes slightly tedious because of the mechanic in which all shields and weapons will break after some usage.If you want, you can run straight to the castle with link in his underpants to defeat Ganon with a stick. The game won't stop you, though the fight may convince you about the need to collect better gear from the various enemy creatures first.",

Now this game is like nothing you have ever played, because it never tells you what you need to do. apart from a tutorial which is a island (it doesnt even tell you it is a tutorial, it just lets you find the way). it just asks 1 question - Are you curious to know why? almost every aspect of the game which you will find out will be simply an answer to this question. if you keep getting killed (and you will keep getting killed, and it will make you want to break things, A LOT!) and even then it wont tell you what you are doing wrong. because there isnt a single correct way of doing things, there are multiple. and everytime you find out a way, the joy it brings at having found a unique way is so so good that it will propel you to go further.lso this doesnt have a linear story line. this is how an open world game should be. where story will follow you. it keeps building where you go. imagine, they dont even mark cities on a map; it is for you to find, this was so new and frustrating for me that it took me an entire month to find my first city because i had no idea what is the point of this game, what should i be doing. even after completing around 80-85 hours there was still a city which i couldnt find and took me a lot of jumping around, poking things, blowing stuff. IT IS AMAZINGevery game review out there has given it a 10 out of 10 rating and it is absolutely justified. do yourself a favor, buy a switch lite and play this so 10-15 years down from now, you have a great story to tell your next generation",

It was my first game on switch. The way the world has been created is very unique. I have played Skyrim, Witcher and am a fan of rpgs in general but never knew a console can make a difference. Nintendo makes few AAA exclusives but the ones they make are worth few times over their cost.",

    "review Text": "Simply sublime. Huge map to explore, densely packed with fun and interesting optional details. Day and night cycles, lunar phases, treacherous thunderstorms and brilliant sunshiny mornings. Chirps of songbirds, cries of wildlife, tall grass and snowy peaks, forests and beaches, capes and islands. Walk, ride, climb or fly. The soft palette just caresses the senses.Uncover the map by searching for towers and shrines that power you up and unlock fast travel. Puzzles and enemies are challenging but fair. I completely eschewed any guides just to savour the experience. There are amusing treasure hunt challenges that expand your inventory - mitigating the weapon durability mechanic which prevents over-reliance on any super-weapon. Controls are simple and intuitive, even for a mouse/keyboard user like myself. X-Y inversion is available.There are nice cutscenes with dialogue whenever the story transitions, but mostly this is a quiet, meditative experience, backed by a sweet, unobtrusive, unrepetitive score. I could go on but i will just end by saying that I waited 3 years to afford this game (and console) and now it’s one of my all-time favourite things.",

    "review Text": "One of the best games I have ever played. The open world is packed with things to do(unlike most open world games). Looking for towers and shrines is a fun process, and finally finding one is oh so satisfying. The map is not restricted at all, so you can just go to the final boss(just to be murdered in the process). It's a true masterclass in game design and a must buy for every switch owner. It is worth buying a switch for.",

Even though the art is quite beautiful, and the overworld is huge.The game has serious issues for a Zelda game, as a matter of fact it is the worst Zelda game ever.It lacks, history, the characters in this entry do not represent their legacy.The Zelda character is bratty, insolent, foolish capricious, basically the whole opposite of what Zelda has always represented.Link, the \"champion\" is not well prepared and weak.Because their terrible skills and aptitudes hyrules fell under a terrible fate.There are no real dungeons.The 4 main dungeons can be passed in less than half hour because it does no have a challenge, not puzzles which is something that characterize any LoZ game.They try to compensate by putting 120 shrines. Those are quite fun to find, because you can explore the whole world, but inside of the shrines it gets very repetitive and without a real difference. It seems like they preferred quantity over quality.The master sword looses its power after a few minutes and you need to wait, use another weapon, the game it is filled with them, but most are borring and fragile.The dlcs are ok, but nothing relevant imho.",

I took a chance on this game as I was not sure I would take to it. But this game makes me want to explore more. Makes me want to find more. I have no regrets! I am a convert to video gaming with this one title.",

I read many reviews about this game and was hesitant to buy it since he expressed that he had never played Zelda and it was a bit pricey . Amazon lowered the price and bought it . Well....it’s been about a month and my bf is obsessed . He plays ALL day ! He’s in the bathroom ,playing . He’s eating ,and playing . Idk what the game has but it must be really good that he goes to sleep really late because of it . Definitely a good purchase",

The stamina system, unpredictable rain and most importantly the breaking weapons make a game feel like a chore too often. For an equivalent game that truly feels fun to play and explore, buy Immortals Fenyx Rising instead.",
